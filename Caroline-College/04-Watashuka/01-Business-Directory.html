<h1><strong>Public History of Watashuka</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>May 1856</strong> â Founding of <strong>Prairieville Academy</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prairieville Academy</strong> is established as a teacher-training school (normal school) to educate future educators. The academy becomes the heart of the town of Prairieville, which later becomes Watashuka. The academy was the dream of three educators Walter Mann, Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling. There dream was to work with the local Ho-Chunk people to bring forth a new era for the region. That dream is still alive today despite setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Founding Members</strong>
<ul>
<li>Walter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy</li>
<li>Eleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated</li>
<li>John W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated</li>
<li>Elias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen</li>
<li>Jonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian</li>
<li>Sarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August 1860</strong> â Destruction of <strong>Prairieville Academy</strong>
<ul>
<li>The academy is destroyed during a violent conflict between the settlers and a rogue native tribe who attacked the school. During the attack many of the educators and founders were killed; only Eleazar Root and John Sterling survived. The academy burned down. Many blame local tensions with indigenous people on the attack. Most records from this time are lost, and it remains a tragic, but poorly understood, event in local history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>September 1862</strong> â Rebuilding of <strong>Prairieville School</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the wake of the academyâs destruction, the <strong>Prairieville School</strong> is built to continue the regionâs educational mission. Under the leadership of Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling the school thrives and grows as part of the effort to revitalize education in the region, attracting settlers to the area. Eleazar served as the school's first principal while John provided the financial and political support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Blizzard of 1888 - Humanitarian Aid</strong>
<ul>
<li>After the Blizzard of 1888, large numbers of members of the Lutheran Church immigrate to the region. The first settlers arrive to provide humanitarian assistance but soon took to calling the region home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>April 1895</strong> â <strong>Caroline Religious Teaching College</strong> Founded
<ul>
<li>Due to the influence of Lutheran immigrants, the <strong>Caroline Religious Teaching College</strong> is established, expanding the former school into a larger institution focused on religious education. The town of <strong>Prairieville</strong> is renamed <strong>Watashuka</strong>, believed to be derived from a misinterpreted Native American word symbolizing the area's different cultural influences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1939-1945</strong> â World War II Efforts
<ul>
<li>Caroline Religious Teaching College contributes to the war effort, with local industry and students engaging in patriotic duties. The collegeâs science and engineering departments grow due to wartime funding. After the war, the college continues expanding its academic programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1945</strong> â <strong>Caroline College</strong> Renamed
<ul>
<li>The college is officially renamed <strong>Caroline College</strong> after WWII, reflecting its role as a modern liberal arts institution. The post-war years bring growth and new facilities, including <strong>Sister Sarahâs Medical Center</strong>, a teaching hospital for nursing and healthcare students.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1969</strong> â Population Decline
<ul>
<li>Watashukaâs population begins to decline in the late 1960s due to changing economic conditions; notably the closing of several government projects now deemed complete. People start leaving for larger cities like Madison and Milwaukee. The closing of some industries and the general economic downturn are seen as the reasons for this decline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>1983-Present</strong> â Present Day Watashuka
<ul>
<li>Watashuka is a quiet rural town with Caroline College as its centerpiece. The town struggles economically, but the college brings new students and some level of vibrancy. Residents are largely unaware of any significant issues beyond normal small-town troubles.</li>

<h3>Atmosphere:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watashukaâs Main Street is the lifeblood of the town, though it has seen better days. Lined with small businesses and family-owned shops, it exudes a nostalgic charm. During the day, it bustles with locals running errands and small talk flowing between shopkeepers and customers. The sounds of typewriters, local radio, and the clinking of glasses at the Blue Heron Pub fill the air. However, as the sun sets, Main Street takes on a different tone. Shadows seem to stretch longer here, and the empty streets echo with an eerie silence. The old brick buildings, now weathered and fading, whisper of past prosperity, but thereâs a creeping unease.</li>
<li>The <strong>side streets</strong> add to the townâs atmosphere of quiet decay, with narrow, cobbled roads leading to forgotten businesses like old law firms and shuttered hardware stores. These roads seem darker at night, and thereâs a sense that they have stories of their own.</li>

<ul>
<li>Librarian: Sly Coolstein</li>

<h3>Outside the town limits to the Southeast: &quot;Lakeview Shores&quot;</h3>
<p>Â <em>{Feel: Resort attractions that have seen better days.}</em></p>
<p>Once a thriving vacation destination, <strong>Lakeview Shores</strong> has seen better days. Nestled along the edge of Lake &quot;View,&quot; this aging resort area was once popular with families seeking outdoor recreation, but a combination of economic decline and neglect has left it in a state of disrepair. The area is now frequented by locals, campers, and the occasional nostalgic visitor, though the glory days are long gone.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sit n' Eat Diner and Motel</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Doris Larkin, a friendly but world-weary woman in her 60s who runs the place single-handedly.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This diner and attached motel are classic roadside Americana, with faded neon signs and a cracked parking lot. Once a bustling stop for tourists, the rooms are now sparsely occupied, and the diner serves mostly local regulars. Despite the wear and tear, Doris keeps the food hot and the coffee flowing. The motel rooms are clean but dated, with dÃ©cor that hasnât been updated since the 1970s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Lake (Public House)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Tom &quot;Big T&quot; Lawson, a burly man in his 50s with a passion for local history and cheap beer.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The Lake is a weathered lakeside tavern that once thrived on summer tourism. Now, itâs mostly filled with locals looking for a cheap drink. The tavern has a large deck overlooking the water, though the view is often shrouded in mist, adding an eerie ambiance. Inside, fishing trophies and old photos of Lakeviewâs heyday decorate the walls. Big T is always ready to share stories of the lakeâs supposed mysteries, though most patrons dismiss them as drunken ramblings. It is almost never visited by college students and is considered a 'locals only' establishment. &quot;<em>Its the only place in town where a good Lutheran can get a drink</em>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lakeside RV Park &amp; Campground</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Marty and Sue Briggs, an aging couple who have managed the site for over 30 years.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The RV park and campground sit on the fringes of Lakeview Shores, offering both short-term and long-term stays. Once a vibrant vacation spot, the campground now attracts a more transient crowd, with only a handful of RVs and tents set up at any given time. The facilities are outdated but functional, and the lakeâs shoreline is overgrown with weeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>All Wet Market &amp; Deli</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Jane and Bob Wheeler, a friendly couple in their late 40s trying to revive the area.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This small market and deli caters to the remaining campers, RV dwellers, and the few vacationers that still trickle in. Despite the areaâs decline, Jane and Bob are optimistic and do their best to offer fresh sandwiches and snacks, even though their stock sometimes sits for weeks before being sold. The building is quaint but worn, with a cheery atmosphere inside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lakeview Lakeside Fun Center (Mini Golf &amp; Arcade)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Dave and Cathy Arnold, a laid-back couple in their 50s who refuse to let the place die.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The Lakeview Fun Center was once a bustling family attraction, complete with mini golf, an arcade, and boat rentals. These days, the mini golf course is overgrown, and most of the arcade machines are out of order, save for a few that still functionâbarely. Dave and Cathy are known for their easygoing attitudes, keeping the place open even if it only gets a few visitors a day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Playhouse on the Lake</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Nancy Bright, a former actress who settled down after her career ended.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This small theater once hosted local plays, musicals, and live performances for vacationers. Now, itâs mostly abandoned, with only a few amateur productions each year. Nancy, an eccentric woman with a flair for the dramatic, still dreams of restoring the theater to its former glory, though few share her enthusiasm. The Playhouse is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former actor who died during a performance, but Nancy waves off such rumors with a smile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The View New Age Shop</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Lucinda &quot;Luce&quot; Moore, a free-spirited woman in her 40s with a deep interest in the supernatural.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This small, quirky shop offers crystals, tarot readings, and other New Age paraphernalia. Luce is one of the few people in Lakeview Shores who embraces the strange energy of the area, and sheâs always ready to discuss local legends or offer advice on warding off spirits. The shop is popular with college students and visitors interested in the occult, though locals are often skeptical of Luceâs claims about the lakeâs mystical powers. Sheâs known to host moonlit gatherings by the lake, though only a few daring souls ever attend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Atmosphere</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite its decline, <strong>Lakeview Shores</strong> holds a certain charm for those who appreciate faded beauty and quiet reflection. The lake, once a source of joy, now seems shrouded in fog and whispers of the unknown. Once a bustling summer retreat, Lakeview Shores has an air of forgotten grandeur. The overgrown paths, weathered motels, and silent campgrounds hint at better days, but now the area feels haunted by time. Despite its decline, Lakeview Shores retains a nostalgic charm for those who remember its heyday.</li>
<li>Lakeview is a working-class neighborhood with a sense of faded optimism. Many of its residents are struggling to make ends meet, and the areaâs rundown houses and overgrown lots are signs of its slow decline. Yet, thereâs a strong community spirit here, where neighbors help each other out, and children still play in the streets. The boarded-up windows and crumbling facades tell the story of a once-thriving part of town, but the people hold onto hope that better days are coming.</li>

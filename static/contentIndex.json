As they dig deeper into the abandoned mill’s history, they discover that the fire was the result of a dark ritual performed by Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled . The ritual was meant to open a portal to another dimension, but something went wrong, leaving behind &quot;cold fire&quot; that still burns beneath the mill ruins, alongside spectral remnants of the failed ritual. The investigators must navigate the mill’s haunted grounds and uncover the truth before the Brotherhood attempts to complete what was left unfinished.\n\nKeeper Information:\nThe Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled used the Stratton Mill as a site for their rituals, aiming to tear the veil between dimensions and bring forth eldritch knowledge and power. On the night of the fire, three cultists led a ritual to open the gate, but the energy they summoned spiraled out of control, consuming the mill in a fire that burned cold—something not of this world. The fire was not natural, and its source still lingers beneath the ruins, along with the restless spirits of the three cultists who perished. The Brotherhood has sent new members to try and finish what was started, using the &quot;cold flame&quot; as a gateway.\n\nAdventure Hooks:\n\n\nA Cry for Help:\nSgt. Jan Ducochik has been investigating the fire in secret, and after uncovering a clue that points to a possible Brotherhood connection, he reaches out to the investigators for help. He’s too close to the case and fears that any more direct involvement will draw unwanted attention. The investigators must pick up where Ducochik left off.\n\n\nStrange Activity at the Ruins:\nLocals report strange lights and eerie humming noises coming from the abandoned Stratton Mill. Some even claim to have seen shadowy figures moving around the site at night. The investigators are hired (by a town council member, a local journalist, or a business owner) to investigate whether trespassers or something more sinister is at play.\n\n\nUnsettling Dreams:\nOne or more of the investigators begin to have disturbing dreams of walking through blue flames, hearing whispers, and seeing shadowy figures beckoning them toward the ruins of the mill. The dreams are accompanied by a growing sense of dread that compels the investigators to visit the site.\n\n\n\nLocations:\n\n\nStratton Mill Ruins:\nThe abandoned mill is a dilapidated structure, overgrown with weeds and vines, surrounded by a rusted chain-link fence. The area is eerily quiet, and the temperature around the ruins is unnaturally cold, even during the day. At night, strange blue flames can occasionally be seen flickering beneath the surface, and an otherworldly hum fills the air.\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe Mill Basement: Beneath the ruins, the remnants of the ritual chamber still exist. Charred symbols line the floor, and the faint blue flames emanate from cracks in the foundation. The portal the cult attempted to open is unstable, leaking energy into the material world.\nThe Cold Fire: The &quot;cold fire&quot; is supernatural in origin and does not behave like a normal flame. It emits no heat and instead seems to drain warmth from the area. It can cause Sanity Loss for those who stare into it for too long.\nThe Spectral Cultists: The ghosts of the three cultists who perished in the failed ritual haunt the mill. They are trapped, reliving the moments before their deaths, unable to move on until the gate is either opened or closed forever.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatashuka Town Records Office:\nBuried deep within the town’s old records are documents about the mill, including inspection reports, property deeds, and an old police report from the night of the fire. However, some of the documents are missing or have been tampered with, hinting at a cover-up.\n\nKey Clues:\n\nA copy of a report from a local police officer who responded to the fire. The report mentions seeing &quot;strange figures&quot; near the mill just before the fire, but the officer’s statement was dismissed as nonsense.\nAn old photo of the mill taken the day after the fire, showing the absence of ash or debris where the fire supposedly occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brotherhood’s Safehouse:\nUnbeknownst to the investigators, the Brotherhood has a safehouse near the mill where they’ve been planning to finish the ritual. The building is an inconspicuous, run-down shack on the outskirts of town, but inside, the walls are covered in occult symbols and diagrams related to the portal. One of the Brotherhood members may be watching the investigators, keeping an eye on their progress.\n\n\n\nImportant NPCs:\n\n\nSergeant Jan Ducochik\n\nRole: The investigator’s contact in town. Ducochik has been investigating the mill fire for years but has kept it quiet to avoid drawing attention. He has suspicions about the Brotherhood’s involvement but doesn’t have enough proof to act. He enlists the investigators’ help to uncover the truth and stop whatever is happening at the mill.\nPersonality: Serious, methodical, with a deep sense of duty to protect the town. While he doesn&#039;t fully believe in the supernatural, he’s seen enough strange things to know something is wrong.\n\n\n\nThe Spectral Cultists\n\nRole: Ghostly remnants of the Brotherhood members who died during the ritual. They are bound to the mill and attempt to lure the investigators into completing the ritual or destroying the gate for good.\nAppearance: They appear as shadowy, indistinct figures, their faces contorted in terror, moving as if they’re still trying to complete the ritual. Their presence can cause Sanity Loss.\n\n\n\nBrotherhood Operatives\n\nRole: The new members of the Brotherhood, sent to finish what was started. They are aware of the investigators’ interest in the mill and may try to stop them or manipulate them into completing the ritual on their behalf.\nPersonality: Cold, calculating, and ruthless. They are fanatically devoted to the Brotherhood’s goals, believing that opening the gate will bring them immense power.\n\n\n\n\nEncounters:\n\n\nThe Cold Fire:\nInvestigators will have to deal with the cold fire that still burns beneath the mill. If they attempt to approach or interact with it, they will experience strange phenomena, such as the air around them freezing, voices whispering in their ears, and flashes of the night of the fire. The fire can only be extinguished by severing its connection to the portal, which will require an occult ritual of their own.\n\nSanity Loss: Looking directly into the cold fire for more than a few moments causes 1d4 Sanity Loss. Being touched by the fire causes 1d6 Sanity Loss and 1d4 physical damage, though the fire leaves no visible wounds.\n\n\n\nSpectral Manifestations:\nThe ghosts of the three cultists will attempt to manipulate the investigators into completing the ritual by guiding them deeper into the mill. The investigators may see the cultists’ final moments play out before them, or hear them chanting in the shadows. At times, the ghosts may turn hostile if they feel the investigators are trying to stop the ritual.\n\nCombat Option: While the ghosts cannot be fought physically, they can be banished by breaking the ritual’s connection to the cold fire.\n\n\n\nThe Brotherhood’s Interference:\nOnce the investigators are close to uncovering the truth, the new members of the Brotherhood will take action. They may attempt to sabotage the investigators&#039; efforts, lure them into a trap, or even trick them into completing the ritual by pretending to be allies. If the investigators discover the Brotherhood’s safehouse, they can find critical clues about how to close the gate.\n\n\n\nClimax:\nThe final showdown takes place in the Mill Basement, where the cold fire burns the brightest, and the portal to another dimension flickers just out of view. The investigators must decide whether to close the portal once and for all, banishing the cold fire and the cultists’ spirits, or allow the Brotherhood to complete the ritual, risking the unleashing of eldritch horrors.\n\n\nClosing the Portal: The investigators will need to use Occult Knowledge and gather materials from the Brotherhood’s safehouse to sever the connection between the cold fire and the portal. This requires a successful Occult roll and possibly the destruction of the mill ruins to prevent the Brotherhood from ever attempting the ritual again.\n\n\nFailing to Stop the Ritual: If the Brotherhood succeeds in completing the ritual, the portal will open fully, allowing a powerful, otherworldly entity to cross into this dimension. The investigators will need to flee as the entity begins warping reality around them, or face it in a desperate struggle for survival.\n\n\n\nAftermath:\n\n\nSuccess: If the investigators close the portal and extinguish the cold fire, the spirits of the cultists will be freed, and the mill will be at peace. Sergeant Ducochik will be grateful for their help, though the town may never know the full truth. However, the Brotherhood may still be watching, waiting for another opportunity.\n\n\nFailure: If the investigators fail to stop the ritual, the portal will remain open, and strange phenomena will begin to plague Watashuka. The Brotherhood will have gained power, and the town’s supernatural troubles will escalate.\n\n\n\nRewards:\n\nSanity Gain: Closing the portal and laying the cultists to rest grants 1d6 Sanity.\nExperience: Investigators will gain experience for uncovering the truth about the mill fire, outsmarting the Brotherhood, and banishing the cold fire.\n"},"caroline-college/Adventures/The-Dissection-Ritual":{"title":"The Dissection Ritual","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/NPCs/Amy-Mann"],"tags":[],"content":"Adventure: The Dissection Ritual\nOverview\nThe players are introduced to a mysterious ritual disguised as a mundane lab exercise.

Loudly Bragging About Non-Existent Parties\n\n“Oh my God, you guys, like, last weekend? I was so wasted, I, like, didn’t even know where I was! It was, like, totally insane. We, like, drank sooo much Bartles &amp; Jaymes. Have you ever had Bartles &amp; Jaymes? It’s, like, so fancy.”\n“Yeah, so, I met this guy—he’s so cute—and, like, we went to this totally secret rave. He said he’s, like, in pre-law? Ugh, so hot. But I totally don’t even, like, remember his name.”\n\n2. Talking About Academic Topics in a Weird, Inappropriate Way (Slipping Up)\n\n“Like, have you guys ever wondered, like, if you could, like, totally stop time? I mean, think about it, like, if you accelerated, like, particles to near-light speed, you’d totally experience time dilation. Like, so crazy, right?”\n“OMG, bodies are, like, so fascinating, you know? Like, all those little mitochondria doing their thing, generating ATP, like, it’s just so cute. It’s like they’re partying in your cells! Totally radical!”\n“You ever think, like, the universe could be, like, a simulation? ‘Cause, like, quantum fluctuations? Totally feels like it, right? Whatever.”\n\n3. Overcompensating to Fit In\n\n“So, like, when are we gonna get to the part of the class where we get to cut stuff open? Like, ew, but also, like, sooo cool, you know?”\n“I’m totally not into, like, math or science or whatever, but, like, my dad said I had to take this class. He’s, like, a really smart guy, though, so I guess he’s right. Whatevs, I’ll figure it out.”\n“Ugh, dissecting things is, like, sooo grody, but also kinda hot, you know? Like, I’m totally not into it, but, like, I could get used to it.”\n\n4. Loud and Inappropriate Comments\n\n“Like, I totally blacked out the other night. We were playing, like, beer pong, and I think I, like, invented a new math formula or something? Hah, that’d be, like, so funny, right?”\n“Oh my God, is this where we, like, cut open frogs or whatever? I heard my friend in bio say they squirt when you poke ‘em. Gag me, right?”\n“This guy, like, came up to me and was all, like, serious? He was, like, ‘You should study more,’ and I’m like, whatever, dude, like, I don’t have time for that, you know? I’m here to, like, have fun!”\n\n5. Accidentally Too Smart\n\n“So, like, when the mitochondria produce ATP during oxidative phosphorylation, it’s, like, sooo efficient, right? I mean, it’s kinda boring, but also, like, fascinating in a molecular biology sense, you know?”\n“Yeah, well, when I was, like, totally wasted the other night, I started thinking about how Heisenberg&#039;s uncertainty principle basically implies we can never know the true state of a particle’s velocity and position at the same time. Ugh, like, what a buzzkill, right?”\n&quot;Wait, don’t you guys know that the Pythagorean theorem only works in Euclidean geometry? Like, duh! But, whatever, right?”\n"},"caroline-college/Documents/Player-Hook":{"title":"Player Hook","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Player Hooks\nMy Dear Robert,\nI hope you are enjoying your extended sabbatical.

The ritual’s climax was meant to bring a period of supernatural fertility to the region, but instead, it triggered a catastrophic and unnatural event—the infamous Blizzard of 1888.\nThe blizzard was no ordinary snowstorm. It swept across the region, dropping temperatures at an unprecedented rate and covering the land in feet of snow within hours. Animals froze in place, and entire homesteads were buried beneath the onslaught. The sky itself seemed to warp, as if torn between dimensions, with flashes of unnatural lightning illuminating the storm. It became clear that the storm was not a mere force of nature, but a manifestation of the ley lines reacting violently to the unfinished ritual.\n\n\nThe Amish and Ho-Chunk Intervention:\n\nBoth the Amish and the Ho-Chunk communities, with their deep understanding of the ley lines and supernatural forces, quickly realized that the blizzard was the result of the botched ritual. Though hesitant to cooperate due to cultural and religious differences, they understood that the survival of the land—and possibly the world—depended on stopping the storm.\nThe Ho-Chunk: Led by spiritual elders, the Ho-Chunk used their ancient rituals to calm the ley lines. They identified sacred locations near the ritual site and channeled the land’s energy to create barriers that would prevent the cult&#039;s power from further spreading. Ho-Chunk warriors, braving the supernatural storm, ventured close to the cult’s gathering, disrupting their ritual by destroying key artifacts and symbols that were amplifying the storm&#039;s intensity.\nThe Amish: The Amish, guided by their secret knowledge passed down through generations, performed a series of protective rituals centered on grounding the ley lines. Using ancient symbols and herbal remedies, they worked to absorb and nullify the dark energies being unleashed. Their actions were crucial in preventing the corruption from spreading to the surrounding farmland. A select group of Amish elders ventured to the heart of the storm, using their knowledge of herbal magic to counteract the ritual’s effects on nature, effectively calming the storm’s destructive force.\nTogether, the Amish and Ho-Chunk managed to weaken the blizzard and break the ley line&#039;s connection to the cult’s ritual site. By dawn, the worst of the storm had passed, though it left the region covered in snow and ice, with many homes and farms destroyed.\n\n\nAftermath for the Cult:\n\nThe Church of the Delayed Blossom suffered a major defeat. Several high-ranking members were killed in the blizzard, unable to control the forces they had unleashed. The remaining cultists were forced to flee, retreating deeper underground to rebuild their strength. Their failure weakened their influence over the land, leaving them fractured and desperate. Some members blamed the botched ritual on interference from Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, further deepening the divide between the two groups.\nThis monumental failure of the ritual, combined with the blizzard’s devastating effects, attracted the attention of the local Lutheran population. Seeing the region as in need of moral and spiritual guidance, Lutheran leaders moved to establish themselves in the area. By 1890, the region had been renamed Watashuka, and the Caroline Religious Teaching College was founded. The Lutherans, unaware of the deeper supernatural forces at play, believed their arrival signaled divine intervention, unaware that the true cause of the storm had been an eldritch power narrowly averted by the joint efforts of the Amish and Ho-Chunk.\n\n\nLegacy of the Blizzard:\n\nLocals still speak of the Blizzard of 1888 with reverence and fear. Though few know the truth, whispers of unnatural forces tied to the storm persist, passed down through generations. The event marked a turning point in the town’s hidden history, with the cults driven deeper underground, the Lutherans unknowingly filling the power vacuum, and the Amish and Ho-Chunk remaining ever-vigilant to prevent such a catastrophe from repeating.\n\n\n"},"caroline-college/Events/The-Baptism-of-'39":{"title":"The Baptism of '39","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled","caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath","caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline"],"tags":[],"content":"The Baptism of &#039;39\n(The Event that Triggered Government Involvement and the Founding of Project Caroline)\nEvent Description:\nThe supernatural disaster that locals now call The Baptism of &#039;39 was the result of a failed time-manipulation ritual by Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled. What began as a sinister attempt to manipulate the ley lines and access alternate timelines spiraled out of control when misled members of the Lutheran Church, believing they were conducting a mass baptism, became unwitting participants in the ritual.\nThe Cover Story:\nAccording to the official—and widely believed—version of events, the Lutheran pastor, Reverend Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Olsen, led a congregation down to Lake Mary for a large-scale baptism ceremony on October 13, 1939. The pastor, a well-respected man in his 50s with a warm and charismatic presence, had recently gathered a group of new converts who were eager to be baptized together. The ceremony took place at dusk, with over a dozen parishioners, young and old, standing along the shore of the lake, singing hymns and preparing to enter the water.\nAs they began the ritual, something went terribly wrong. Inexplicable phenomena occurred—strange lights flickered above the water, and a sudden, bone-chilling fog rolled in from nowhere. The water in the lake rose, unnaturally high, forming bizarre swirling patterns. Congregants were pulled into the water by unseen forces, while others stood frozen in place, unable to move or speak. The skies above seemed to shimmer, and witnesses described seeing distorted reflections in the lake—visions of past and future events, alternate versions of themselves, and eerie figures that never existed.\nThe church members were trapped in what seemed like a time anomaly, as the rising waters of Lake Mary acted as a temporal gateway. Some were thrown forward in time, while others vanished entirely. A few survivors were found later, dazed and confused, with no memory of the event beyond stepping into the water. Local authorities chalked it up to a freak accident, but those closest to the church whispered about demonic interference.\nThe True Cause:\nUnbeknownst to Reverend Olsen or his congregation, the baptism was actually the culmination of a ritual being conducted by Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled. Cultists embedded within the congregation had altered the baptism’s timing and location to coincide with an arcane ritual designed to manipulate time. Their goal was to create a rift in time using the ley lines converging at Lake Mary, allowing them to gain knowledge from alternate dimensions and use that power to summon the &quot;original god.&quot;\nHowever, the interference of the Lutheran congregation—believing they were engaged in a holy ritual—disrupted the cult’s carefully laid plans. The energy they had hoped to harness from the ley lines surged out of control, and instead of manipulating time in a controlled way, they unleashed an unstable rift. The rising waters of Lake Mary became a temporal whirlpool, pulling people into alternate timelines and distorting reality.\nAftermath:\n\nFor the Cults:\n\nBrotherhood of the Gate Unveiled suffered a major setback. The ritual had backfired spectacularly, resulting in the deaths or disappearances of several high-ranking cult members who were caught in the time anomaly. Some cultists were flung into the future or past, while others were twisted into bizarre, unrecognizable forms by their exposure to alternate dimensions. The Brotherhood’s leadership was left fractured, and they were forced to retreat deeper into secrecy to rebuild their power and recover from the failed ritual.\nChurch of the Delayed Blossom saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. Shub-Niggurath, often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence. See below\n\n\nFor the Lutheran Church:\nReverend Fred Olsen was devastated by the event. He had no knowledge of the cult’s involvement, and in his eyes, the tragedy was a catastrophic accident—a test of faith. Reverend Olsen became more reclusive in the years following the event, haunted by the loss of his parishioners. The survivors, confused and traumatized, were never the same, and many left the church. The Baptism of &#039;39 remains a stain on the church’s history, and the Lutheran congregation worked hard to distance themselves from the event, reinforcing the cover story that it had been a freak natural disaster.\nFor the Town:\nMost locals accepted the church’s explanation of the event. While rumors of supernatural occurrences circulated, particularly among older residents, the official story held. The Baptism of &#039;39 became a cautionary tale about the dangers of Lake Mary, with many avoiding the lake after dark for fear of &quot;bad luck&quot; or worse. The lake developed a reputation for being haunted, and strange phenomena continued to be reported in the years following the event—echoes of voices from the past, distorted reflections in the water, and the occasional unexplained disappearance.\n\nGovernment Involvement and the Birth of Project Caroline:\nWhile the locals might have accepted the cover story, the government took notice of the strange anomalies surrounding the Baptism of &#039;39. Reports of missing persons, time distortions, and bizarre weather patterns at Lake Mary reached the desk of Agent Howard Fitzsimmons, a sharp and inquisitive investigator with the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)—a government agency tasked with exploring unusual phenomena, especially during the early years of WWII.\nFitzsimmons, in his early 40s and known for his no-nonsense approach, was sent to investigate. He quickly determined that something far more unusual than a baptism had taken place. Interviews with survivors and local authorities, as well as his own experience with classified government experiments, led Fitzsimmons to conclude that the ley lines around Lake Mary had been disturbed by some kind of occult activity. He suspected that the event was tied to time manipulation, though he lacked concrete evidence.\nFitzsimmons’ report to the OSRD recommended further investigation into the supernatural properties of the Watashuka region. His superiors, impressed by his findings and the potential implications for time manipulation in wartime technology, authorized the creation of Project Caroline in 1940. Fitzsimmons was appointed as the project’s first director, tasked with uncovering the secrets of the ley lines and understanding how the energies around Watashuka could be harnessed.\nLegacy of the Baptism of &#039;39:\nThe Baptism of &#039;39 became the founding event for Project Caroline, the top-secret government initiative that would study the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka for decades to come. Fitzsimmons’ work laid the foundation for the project’s ongoing investigation into time anomalies, ley lines, and the influence of the cults operating in the shadows of the town.\nThough Reverend Olsen and the Lutheran Church continued to distance themselves from the tragedy, the event marked the beginning of a new chapter in Watashuka’s secret history—one where government agents, cults, and local residents became unwitting players in a much larger cosmic game.\nThe Wet Spot: The Aftermath of a Failed Ritual\n(A Cult Capitalizing on Rival Failure and Hidden Desires)\nThe Baptism of &#039;39 of 1939 not only left deep scars on Watashuka&#039;s lakes and time itself but also created lingering, unseen consequences in the land and people near Lake Mary. While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled suffered a tremendous setback from their failed time manipulation ritual, their rivals— Church of the Delayed Blossom —saw an opportunity.\nThe botched ritual had temporarily destabilized the ley lines near Lake Mary, leaving the area around it highly susceptible to supernatural corruption and manipulation. The Delayed Blossom cult saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. Shub-Niggurath, often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence.\nThe Founding of The Wet Spot:\nIn the early 1940s, shortly after the Baptism of &#039;39, a quiet shift occurred in the area just beyond the town limits, near Lake Mary. What had once been a respectable lakeside resort fell into disrepair, as locals avoided the area due to the unnatural feelings of discomfort and fear. Without fully understanding why, residents felt uneasy near the water, especially at night. Many reported strange dreams or sudden impulses they couldn’t explain.\nSensing the opportunity, members of the Church of the Delayed Blossom began subtly influencing the land and those who still ventured near Lake Mary. Over time, their efforts coalesced into something more overt. In 1952, under the guidance of &quot;Big&quot; Tony D’Amato, an outsider with connections to the town’s seedier elements, The Wet Spot was established. Officially an adult establishment, The Wet Spot catered to the baser instincts of the town&#039;s population—sex, indulgence, and secrecy. Unofficially, it became a node of power for the Delayed Blossom, feeding off the suppressed desires of its patrons and slowly corrupting the land further.\nThe Church of the Delayed Blossom’s Influence:\nThe Church of the Delayed Blossom thrives on exploiting the primal, chaotic aspects of humanity, particularly sexuality, fertility, and uncontrolled growth. The establishment of The Wet Spot near Lake Mary, on land already tainted by the failed ritual, allowed the cult to further anchor their influence in Watashuka.\n\nSexuality as a Tool: For the Delayed Blossom cult, sexuality is not just a human urge—it is a form of power. By opening an establishment like The Wet Spot, the cult taps into the suppressed desires of the town, using the indulgence of lust and vice as a way to fuel their rituals. The sexual energy released at the club serves as a type of fertility magic, subtly warping the land and spreading Shub-Niggurath’s influence through the area.\nTwisting the Failure: While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in their time manipulation, the Delayed Blossom found a way to benefit from the weakened ley lines. The ritual’s disruption left Lake Mary’s surroundings spiritually vulnerable, making it easier for the Delayed Blossom to exert their influence over the region and its residents. The Wet Spot, positioned in an area avoided by most locals, became a hidden focal point for the cult’s activities.\n\nThe Wet Spot’s Reputation:\nTo this day, The Wet Spot maintains its outward appearance as a sleazy but profitable adult establishment, frequented by college students and visitors passing through. While most of the town avoids the place, chalking it up to personal morals or discomfort, many don’t realize that the real reason they stay away stems from the lingering supernatural energy left over from the 1939 event.\n\nStrange Atmosphere: Those who do visit often report a strange atmosphere in the club. The air feels thick, like it’s charged with something unexplainable. Time seems to slow, and people lose track of the hours they spend inside. There are rumors that some patrons have gone missing, never seen again after a night out at the club, though this is written off as typical seedy rumors.\nUnnatural Growth: Unbeknownst to most, The Wet Spot serves as a breeding ground for darker, more unnatural forces. The cult uses the energy of indulgence and sexual desire to foster their connection to Shub-Niggurath. Some areas near the club are marked by strange growths—twisted plants, unusual fertility in the soil, and occasional sightings of hybrid creatures, believed to be the results of dark rituals.\nDormant Power: The Delayed Blossom cult maintains a low profile, using The Wet Spot as a cover for their true activities. While not every patron is affected by the cult’s influence, those who frequent the establishment regularly often find themselves plagued by strange dreams and desires. Some even become unwitting pawns in the cult’s ongoing efforts to manipulate and corrupt the town’s ley lines.\n\nLegacy of the Baptism of &#039;39:\nThe Baptism of &#039;39’s aftermath left scars not only on the landscape but on the people as well. The Wet Spot, though seemingly just an adult entertainment venue, is a lingering reminder of how the disrupted ritual in 1939 forever altered the spiritual fabric of Watashuka. Where the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in controlling time, the Church of the Delayed Blossom succeeded in harnessing the primal urges of humanity to further their influence in the town.\nKey Figures:\n\nReverend Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Olsen: Lutheran pastor who led the ill-fated baptism ceremony. A warm, charismatic man in his 50s, he was devastated by the events of 1939 and spent the rest of his life in quiet, guilt-ridden reflection.\nAgent Howard Fitzsimmons: Government investigator with the OSRD who was assigned to the case. His investigation into the Baptism of &#039;39 led to the creation of Project Caroline, and he became its first director. Fitzsimmons was known for his sharp mind, skepticism, and unrelenting drive to uncover the truth.\n&quot;Big&quot; Tony D’Amato: Transplant from Indiana who established the Wet Spot under cult suggestion. Tony is not a cultist and tries to distance himself from their activities but at the end of the day, he is a businessman.\n"},"caroline-college/Factions/Amish":{"title":"Amish","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline","caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled","caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath","caroline-college/Factions/Lutheran-Church","caroline-college/Factions/Ho-Chunk"],"tags":[],"content":"Amish Protectors\nThe Amish in the Watashuka region are covert protectors, using ancient knowledge to defend against supernatural forces. They have a complicated relationship with the Ho-Chunk people and the Lutheran Church, which remains largely unaware of the true threat.\nOverview\n\nThe area surrounding Watashuka is home to a large and seemingly traditional Amish population. They are known for their simple, agrarian lifestyle, shunning modern technology and maintaining a close-knit, self-sufficient community. The Amish are generally seen as peaceful and reserved, with little interaction with the broader town beyond necessary trade and commerce.\n\nSecret Role:\n\nUnbeknownst to the locals, the Amish presence in the Watashuka region is far from accidental. They are the guardians of an ancient knowledge passed down through generations, tasked with protecting the world from the malevolent forces that others unknowingly or deliberately seek to unleash. The Amish view themselves as the last line of defense against the supernatural entities and dark powers at play in Watashuka.\nThe Amish are particularly focused on countering the efforts of the two warring cults as well as the U.S. government&#039;s ongoing operations under Project Caroline. They believe these factions are meddling with forces beyond human comprehension, threatening to bring about catastrophic consequences.\nThe Amish see the Lutheran Church as potential allies, albeit ones who are largely unaware of the true scale of the supernatural conflict and one who is often misled, fooled or manipulated by forces of evil. Similarly, they have a complicated relationship with the Ho-Chunk people, who possess their own ancient knowledge and spiritual practices. While the Amish respect the Ho-Chunk&#039;s traditions, they remain cautious, recognizing that the Ho-Chunk have their own goals and methods for dealing with the supernatural.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe Amish use a combination of ancient rituals, herbal remedies, and a deep understanding of the supernatural to keep the dark forces at bay. Their methods are subtle and often go unnoticed by the untrained eye, appearing as mere traditions or superstitions to outsiders.\nThey have developed a network of hidden safehouses, sanctuaries, and spiritual sites throughout the region, where they conduct their rituals and plan their strategies. These locations are well-guarded, both physically and spiritually, making them difficult for outsiders to discover or infiltrate.\nThe Amish maintain strict secrecy about their true purpose, even among their own community members. Only a select few within the community—those chosen and trained in the ancient ways—are fully aware of the ongoing supernatural battle and their role in it.\n\nInteractions with Other Factions:\n\nProject Caroline: The Amish view the government&#039;s continued experiments as reckless and dangerous. While they generally avoid direct confrontation, they work quietly to undermine the government&#039;s efforts, using their knowledge of the land and supernatural to disrupt operations.\nThe Cults: The Amish are actively working against the cults, using their own rituals and protective measures to neutralize the cults&#039; influence. They have been known to rescue individuals targeted by the cults, though these actions are always done in secrecy. There primary &#039;enemy&#039; is the Church of the Delayed Blossom. While Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled is a concerning group for the Amish, they see Shub-Niggurath as the bigger threat.\nLutheran Church: While the Lutheran Church is largely unaware of the supernatural dangers lurking in Watashuka, the Amish see them as potential allies. The Amish may occasionally influence church leaders or provide subtle guidance, hoping to strengthen the church&#039;s spiritual defenses. However, they also are very aware of how fragile the church is in regard to that defense. The Lutherans are potential allies that are being manipulated into possibly becoming the enemy.\nHo-Chunk The Amish respect the Ho-Chunk&#039;s ancient knowledge and spiritual practices. However, they remain wary, understanding that the Ho-Chunk have their own agenda in dealing with the supernatural. The two groups have an uneasy alliance, cooperating when necessary but keeping their distance otherwise.\n\nImpact on Watashuka:\n\nThe Amish&#039;s covert activities contribute to the strange and sometimes inexplicable phenomena that occur around Watashuka. Their presence, while largely unnoticed by the town’s population, plays a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between the forces at work in the region. They also try to protect the town by offering untainted foods and goods.\nTheir actions also add a layer of mystery and tension to the town&#039;s atmosphere, with rumors and whispers circulating about odd occurrences or unexplained events near Amish farms. However, few would suspect the true nature of the Amish’s involvement in the supernatural struggle.\n\nActivities\nDisrupting Cult Rituals:\nThe Amish are secretly sabotaging rituals performed by the cult of Shub-Niggurath, particularly around the farmlands. They work quietly to neutralize mystical energies without drawing attention.\nGuarding and Creating Sacred Sites:\nThe Amish maintain hidden sanctuaries in the countryside, where they conduct rituals to keep malevolent entities at bay. These sites sometimes overlap with Ho-Chunk sacred grounds, creating tension between the two factions.\nRecruiting Allies in the Lutheran Church:\nThe Amish are quietly identifying sympathetic members within the Lutheran Church to form a secret alliance against the cults. They work to reveal hidden truths to certain key figures, hoping to bolster the church’s resistance to evil forces.\nMonitoring the Ho-Chunk People:\nWhile respecting their traditions, the Amish are secretly keeping tabs on the Ho-Chunk, ensuring that their own ancient rituals don’t accidentally unleash the very forces both groups are fighting.\nUsing Agricultural Connections:\nThe Amish manipulate the agricultural supply chains in Watashuka to subtly disrupt the cult’s efforts to use local resources for their dark rituals.\nSabotaging College Research:\nBy infiltrating Caroline College’s agricultural programs, the Amish slow down research that might unwittingly tap into dark forces hidden in the land.\nCombating Created Monsters:\nThe Amish attempt to destroy the Dark Young and other monstrosities that the cult create."},"caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled":{"title":"Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled","links":["caroline-college/NPCs/Yog-Sothoth","caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline","caroline-college/Factions/Amish","caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College","caroline-college/Factions/Lutheran-Church","caroline-college/Factions/Ho-Chunk","caroline-college/Events/The-Baptism-of-'39"],"tags":[],"content":"The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled\nThis cult follows Yog-Sothoth, the Outer God of time, space, and dimensional gates.

This scheme is monitored by both the Lutheran Church and Project Caroline operatives, who are quietly attempting to intervene.\nGaining Control of the Obelisk:\nThe cult of Yog-Sothoth is waiting to gain control over the Obelisk of Nekhbet, believing it to be a key to unlocking their god’s power. This goal brings them into conflict with both the Ho-Chunk and the Amish. They ultimate goal is to complete a their final ritual to awaken the &#039;original god&#039;. They believe a key to this ritual involves the Obelisk as well as other structures on campus.\nSabotaging Project Caroline:\nThe cult is undermining Project Caroline’s efforts to contain supernatural forces, hoping to further their own agenda. However, some factions within Project Caroline may secretly be working with the cult for their own benefit.\nInfluencing Local Politicians:\nThe cult is using its influence to control local politics, ensuring that laws and decisions benefit their long-term plans. This manipulation is largely unknown to other factions, though Project Caroline is beginning to suspect.\nGathering Forbidden Knowledge:\nThe cult is infiltrating libraries, museums, and archives to collect ancient texts and occult knowledge. This puts them at odds with the Ho-Chunk and the Amish, both of whom seek to keep such knowledge hidden or neutralized.\nSummoning Eldritch Entities:\nThe cult is actively trying to summon smaller eldritch entities as part of larger rituals. These attempts often clash with the Amish’s efforts to stop such activities.\nTargeting Ho-Chunk Leaders:\nThe cult is targeting influential members of the Ho-Chunk community, believing them to be obstacles in their plans. This strategy risks igniting open conflict with the Ho-Chunk people.\nUndermining the Lutheran Church:\nThe cult is quietly working to destabilize the Lutheran Church’s influence in town, hoping to weaken its role as a moral and spiritual guide. They have often placed their own cult members in positions of power within the church over the years (see The Baptism of &#039;39).\nExperimenting with Time Distortions:\nThe cult is conducting experiments to manipulate time for their rituals.

This scheme brings them into conflict with the Amish and the Ho-Chunk, who are working to purify the land. This work includes manipulation of the food sources in the town (via interference with local grocery stories and food processing facilities), the manipulation of crops and the creation of Dark Young. To this end, the cult has great control over the agricultural and environmental buildings on campus. The Dark Young can be mistaken for trees. These monsters hide in the experimental orchards, farms and environmental preserves around the area.\nCreating Hybrid Creatures:\nThe cult is experimenting with dark rituals to create hybrid creatures. These experiments take place in both humans and animal experiments. As such the cult has great control over the teaching hospital and the veterinarian school. They have actively worked to ensure that no other medical faculty, human or animal, is allowed in the region. They are actively experimenting on pregnant humans and animals.\nSummoning Shub-Niggurath’s Spawn:\nThe cult is attempting to summon smaller spawn of Shub-Niggurath, Dark Young, to strengthen their presence in the region.

Deeply connected to the natural world and the spiritual energies that flow through the earth, the Ho-Chunk are the ancient protectors of the region’s ley lines—the powerful, invisible pathways that connect the land to the supernatural realms.\nThe Ho-Chunk have always known that the land they call home is special, a place where the boundaries between worlds are thinner, and where spiritual energy pools in certain sacred sites. These ley lines are both a blessing and a curse, offering great power but also attracting dark forces that seek to exploit them. The Ho-Chunk’s traditional role has been to guard these sites, using their spiritual knowledge and rituals to protect the land from those who would misuse its power—whether they be human or something far older and more dangerous.\nThough their numbers have dwindled, the Ho-Chunk continue to fulfill this ancient duty, even in the face of growing threats from government projects, local cults, and the encroaching modern world.\nBeliefs and Role as Guardians:\nThe Ho-Chunk believe that the ley lines are pathways that connect the natural world to the spiritual realms, channels through which energy flows between different dimensions. Certain points along these lines, known as &quot;power nodes,&quot; are places where the veil between worlds is thinnest, and where great spiritual power can be harnessed—either for good or ill.\nFor the Ho-Chunk, these sites are sacred. They see themselves as the appointed guardians of the land, responsible for maintaining the balance between the natural and supernatural worlds. Their role is to ensure that the ley lines remain undisturbed, and that the ancient entities that dwell beyond the veil are not summoned or awakened.\n\n\nRituals of Protection: The Ho-Chunk use rituals passed down through generations to safeguard the ley lines. These rituals involve chanting, the use of sacred herbs, and the drawing of protective symbols on the earth. The Ho-Chunk know that certain rituals must be performed regularly to keep the ley lines in balance, preventing any one group from harnessing too much of their power.\n\n\nCommunication with Spirits: The Ho-Chunk maintain a deep connection to the spirit world. Their shamans, known as &quot;Wąąk Toošewe,&quot; act as intermediaries between the human world and the spirits of the land. These shamans can sense disturbances in the ley lines and are able to communicate with the spirits of nature to help keep the land protected.\n\n\nEldritch Awareness: Unlike the local settlers, who only recently discovered the dangers of the eldritch forces lurking beneath Watashuka, the Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the presence of these beings. They refer to these ancient entities as &quot;the Hungry Ones&quot;, spirits who were banished from the natural world long ago and now seek to return through breaches in the ley lines. The Ho-Chunk believe that once the Hungry Ones are allowed into this world, they will consume all life, and their return must be prevented at all costs.\n\n\n\nRelationship with the Amish:\nThough the Ho-Chunk and the Amish come from vastly different cultural backgrounds, they have shared a common purpose since the late 19th century: the protection of the land from supernatural threats. The alliance between the two groups was born out of necessity in the 1890s, when a failed ritual by Church of the Delayed Blossom nearly brought an eldritch entity into the world.\n\n\nThe Alliance: At first, the Amish and the Ho-Chunk were wary of one another. The Amish, with their Christian beliefs, were initially suspicious of the Ho-Chunk’s spiritual practices, while the Ho-Chunk saw the Amish as outsiders who did not understand the land’s deeper significance. However, after the Blizzard of 1888, the two groups found common ground in their shared desire to protect the land from the forces that sought to corrupt it. Though the alliance is largely unspoken, both groups respect one another and often work together in secret to combat threats to the ley lines.\n\n\nMaintaining Distance: Despite their cooperation, the Ho-Chunk and Amish maintain separate spheres of influence. The Ho-Chunk focus on the ley lines and sacred sites, while the Amish use their herbal magic and symbolic protections to guard their farmlands and the surrounding area. The two groups communicate infrequently, but when major disturbances occur, they come together to combine their knowledge and abilities.\n\n\nRecent Conflicts:\nGovernment Encroachment (1930s-Present):\nThe Ho-Chunk have become increasingly concerned with the U.S. government’s activities in the region, particularly the founding of Project Caroline in the 1940s. Though the government claims its experiments are purely scientific, the Ho-Chunk know that the government is tampering with forces beyond their control, disturbing the ley lines in dangerous ways. The Ho-Chunk elders have issued warnings to the local authorities, but these have been ignored or dismissed as superstitious nonsense.\nShamanic Observations:\nThe Ho-Chunk shamans have noted strange fluctuations in the ley lines ever since Dr. Amy Mann experiments in the early 1980s. They believe that the creation of the time loop in 1983 is a direct result of the government’s meddling with the ley lines, and they have been working tirelessly to find a way to break the loop and restore balance to the land.\nCults of Watashuka:\nThe Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the two rival cults operating in Watashuka. Both cults seek to exploit the ley lines for their own dark purposes, and the Ho-Chunk view them as a constant threat.\n\nChurch of the Delayed Blossom: The Ho-Chunk see the Church of the Delayed Blossom, followers of Shub-Niggurath, as dangerous because of their focus on corrupting the natural world. The church’s fertility rituals threaten to warp the land, and the Ho-Chunk have intervened on numerous occasions to stop these rituals before they could come to fruition.\nBrotherhood of the Gate Unveiled: The Ho-Chunk are more wary the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, whose experiments with time manipulation could have catastrophic consequences for the entire region, the world or even the universe. The Brotherhood’s attempts to create rifts in time threaten to unravel the fabric of reality, and the Ho-Chunk have dedicated themselves to preventing these rituals from succeeding.\n\nKey Ho-Chunk Figures:\n\n\nChief John Nąąhųc (Tree Bear):\n\nRole: The current leader of the Ho-Chunk in the Watashuka region, Chief John Nąąhųc is a respected elder who has guided his people through many hardships. He is deeply connected to the spiritual forces of the land and takes his role as guardian of the ley lines very seriously. Nąąhųc is stoic and cautious, believing that the best way to protect the land is through quiet vigilance and careful intervention. He has worked closely with the Amish when necessary but prefers to keep his people out of the town’s politics. He is known for his love of Dr. Pepper.\n\n\n\nJane Deerwalker:\n\nRole: One of the most powerful Wąąk Toošewe (shamans) in the Ho-Chunk community, Jane Deerwalker is responsible for maintaining the spiritual balance of the ley lines. She has the ability to sense disturbances in the spiritual realm and often serves as the first line of defense when the cults or government experiments cause disruptions. Jane is known for her wisdom and is often consulted by Chief Nąąhųc on matters related to the supernatural. She is particularly wary of the time loop created by Dr. Amy Mann and has been working on a way to counteract its effects.\n\n\n\nKetih Redfeather:\n\nRole: A young Ho-Chunk warrior and apprentice to Deerwalker, Keith Redfeather is fiercely protective of his people and the land. He often serves as a scout, keeping an eye on the activities of both the cults and the government. Though he lacks the spiritual experience of his elders, Keith is brave and quick to act, often clashing with his more cautious superiors. He is deeply suspicious of outsiders and is particularly hostile toward Project Caroline, seeing it as a direct threat to the ley lines.\n\n\n\n\nKey Locations:\nGrove of the Two Trees:\nThis sacred site is a powerful ley line node where two ancient oak trees stand, their roots intertwined in a way that suggests they have grown together for centuries. The Ho-Chunk believe this grove is one of the most important power points in the region and perform regular rituals here to maintain balance. Church of the Delayed Blossom has attempted to use this site for mutation rituals, but the Ho-Chunk have successfully defended it each time.\nThe Caves of Lake Mary:\nThese caves, located near Lake Mary, are believed to be an entry point to the spirit world. The Ho-Chunk used to use the caves for their most sacred ceremonies before the events of The Baptism of &#039;39. Now only Wąąk Toošewe are allowed to enter. The caves are said to contain ancient carvings that map the ley lines and predict the coming of the Hungry Ones if the ley lines are ever fully corrupted.\nLegacy:\nThe Ho-Chunk’s presence in Watashuka has been largely overshadowed by the town’s more visible history, but their role as guardians of the ley lines remains vital. In a town filled with hidden dangers—government conspiracies, warring cults, and supernatural entities—the Ho-Chunk continue to protect the balance, often without recognition or thanks. Their vigilance is all that stands between the land and the ancient forces that seek to consume it.\nActivities\nPreserving Sacred Sites:\nThe Ho-Chunk are quietly protecting their sacred sites from government and cult interference. This effort puts them at odds with Project Caroline, which is conducting experiments on or near these locations.\nSharing Knowledge with the Amish:\nSome members of the Ho-Chunk are working with the Amish to exchange ancient knowledge. This uneasy alliance is based on mutual respect but could fall apart if trust is broken.\nBreak the Time Loop:\nElders of the tribe have detected the time loop and attempt to either break the loop or at least pass knowledge from loop to the next.\nCombating Created Monsters:\nThe Ho-Chunk attempt to destroy the monstrosities that the cult create.\nSabotaging Cult Rituals:\nThe Ho-Chunk are actively working to disrupt the cult rituals, particularly those that desecrate the land. They may use their spiritual knowledge to neutralize dark powers, unknowingly aligning with the Amish in these efforts.\nAdvising Caroline College Faculty:\nCertain Ho-Chunk leaders are offering subtle guidance to faculty at Caroline College, steering them away from research paths that might inadvertently lead to supernatural dangers. This puts them in quiet conflict with Project Caroline operatives.\nFostering Cultural Awareness:\nThe Ho-Chunk people are working to promote cultural awareness through the Ho-Chunk Cultural Heritage Museum, hoping to protect their traditions from external influences. This brings them into indirect conflict with Project Caroline’s attempts to exploit their knowledge. It is through this awareness that the tribe hopes to pass knowledge from one time loop to the next. They make use of the various museums and heritage centers in the region for this.\nMonitoring Project Caroline:\nThe Ho-Chunk are aware of the government attempts to make use of eldritch magic. They are actively attempting to stop this exploitation as they believe that the government does not understand the dangers they are putting every at risk of.\nNeutralizing Government Technology:\nThe Ho-Chunk are using their spiritual practices to subtly interfere with government surveillance and experiments, particularly in areas they deem sacred.\nGuarding Against Yog-Sothoth Followers:\nThe Ho-Chunk are closely watching the cult of Yog-Sothoth, believing that their summoning rituals could unleash devastating forces. They are actively working to stop these rituals but may come into conflict with the Amish over methods and intentions."},"caroline-college/Factions/Lutheran-Church":{"title":"Lutheran Church","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Lutheran Church\nRepresents the religious populace but unknowingly entangled in the cult&#039;s schemes.\nThe Lutheran Church in Watashuka has historically been unaware of the actual occult forces at work in the town.

This could attract unwanted attention from Project Caroline or the cults."},"caroline-college/Factions/Metalheads":{"title":"Metalheads","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Mothers-Opposing-Metal","caroline-college/NPCs/Dave"],"tags":[],"content":"The Metalheads (Local Counterculture and Occult Fighters)\nOverview:\nIn the early 1980s, Watashuka’s Metalhead community is a tight-knit group of teenagers and young adults who rally around heavy metal music, tabletop role-playing games, and the rebellion of youth counterculture. What makes them unique in Watashuka is their hidden role as one of the few groups actively fighting against the occult forces that threaten the town. Unlike the stereotypes of the time, which painted them as devil-worshipping delinquents, these outcasts use their knowledge of obscure lore, occult symbols, and music to resist eldritch forces, often working in the shadows to prevent horrors that most townspeople never see.\nRole in Town:\nViewed with suspicion and disdain by the more conservative residents of Watashuka, the Metalheads are frequently blamed for vandalism, strange disappearances, and even weather anomalies. Their loud music, punk rock attire, and unconventional interests make them easy targets for the Mothers Opposing Metal group, the town’s moral watchdogs. However, behind their rebellious exterior, they are actually one of the few factions in Watashuka actively working to combat the cults and dark powers manipulating the town.\nBase of Operations:\nMany of the Metalheads hang out at Jack’s Surfer: Comics &amp; Games or at the Blue Heron Pub. This group is heavily influenced by metal music’s cryptic lyrics and the imagery of fantasy role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which have inadvertently led them to discover real occult knowledge hidden within the town&#039;s dark history.\nNotable Figures:\n\n“Raven” Becky Thompson: One of the few female Metalheads in town, Becky is fiercely independent and well-versed in occult symbols and esoteric rituals. She spends her days researching local folklore at The Prince: New &amp; Used Books and her nights planning counter-attacks against the cultists, using her knowledge of heavy metal and mythology.\nEddie “Styx” Delano: Eddie is the town’s go-to guy for rituals that require certain &quot;artifacts&quot; like skulls, daggers, and ritual books. He’s resourceful, knowing how to procure these items without raising suspicion. Despite his rough appearance, Eddie is serious about fighting the occult forces, and he has a strong moral code, believing they must protect the innocent from the eldritch horrors lurking in the town.\n\nActivities:\n\nOccult Research: The Metalheads spend much of their time researching occult symbols and rituals that can be found in their music and games, giving them an edge when it comes to identifying cult activity.\nDisrupting Rituals: They&#039;ve made it their mission to disrupt local cults by graffitiing occult symbols that interfere with rituals, performing counter-rituals themselves, and even engaging in direct action when necessary.\nUnderground Communication: Using Dave&#039;s radio show, the Metalheads pass coded messages to each other about cult movements and activities.\nPublic Perception: Feared and misunderstood by the general populace, the Metalheads are often accused of satanic rituals themselves, especially by the Mothers Opposing Metal (MOM) group. Their music and games are seen as gateways to evil, even though the reality is that they are often the ones standing between the town and much darker forces.\n"},"caroline-college/Factions/Mothers-Opposing-Metal":{"title":"Mothers Opposing Metal","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Metalheads","caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled"],"tags":[],"content":"MOM: Mothers Opposing Metal (Moral Watchdogs and Anti-Occult Activists)\nOverview:\nMothers Opposing Metal (MOM) is a group of highly conservative mothers, fathers and community members in Watashuka who believe that heavy metal music, role-playing games, and anything associated with counterculture is a gateway to devil worship and societal decay. Founded in response to the rising popularity of metal music and games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, MOM is determined to root out what they see as the growing influence of the occult, often targeting the Metalheads and their associated subculture as the prime instigators of evil in the town.\nRole in Town:\nMOM holds considerable sway over local politics, religious organizations, and the school system. They have pressured the Lutheran Church, the school board, and local law enforcement to crack down on anything they perceive as occult-related, from album covers to role-playing game paraphernalia. However, unbeknownst to them, their crusade against the Metalheads distracts the town from the real supernatural threats: the secretive cults embedded in Watashuka’s institutions.\nBase of Operations:\nThe group typically meets at All Saints Lutheran Church or in the living rooms of its more prominent members. These meetings are filled with prayer, discussion of moral purity, and planning sessions to counteract what they see as the satanic influences in town. MOM often organizes public events, like anti-metal rallies, book burnings, and community outreach to &quot;save&quot; the youth.\nNotable Figures:\n\nNancy Mueller (Leader): Nancy is the founder and driving force behind MOM. The wife of Pastor Daniel Mueller of All Saints Lutheran Church, she sees herself as the moral compass of the town. Nancy is deeply religious and believes that Watashuka’s problems stem from allowing corrupting influences like metal music and role-playing games into the community. Though she has good intentions, Nancy is blind to the real evil lurking beneath the surface.\nSandra Pike: Sandra is Nancy’s right-hand woman and an expert at mobilizing local parents to join their cause. A fiery speaker, she often leads public demonstrations against the Metalheads and has a reputation for stirring up fear among the townspeople.\nKaren Albright: A zealous member of MOM, Karen is obsessed with monitoring the actions of the Metalheads. Her son, who is secretly part of the Metalhead group, has been estranged from her, which fuels her crusade to save other children from the &quot;satanic influences.&quot;\n\nActivities:\n\nPublic Demonstrations: MOM holds rallies and prayer vigils in protest of concerts, game nights at Jack’s Surfer, and other events associated with the Metalhead community. These events are often loud and gain significant attention from the local media.\nMoral Crusades: MOM has successfully pressured local authorities to raid Jack’s Surfer and confiscate game books, music records, and other materials they deem &quot;satanic.&quot; They’ve also convinced the school board to ban certain music and literature from the high school, labeling it as dangerous to the youth.\nSurveillance of Youth: Members of MOM are notorious for keeping a close eye on their children&#039;s activities. They often spy on local teenagers, monitoring their music and friendships, and report any &quot;suspicious&quot; behavior to local authorities.\nPublic Perception: While they are respected by many of the older and more religious townspeople, MOM is also seen as overbearing and alarmist by younger generations. The Metalheads and other teens view them as clueless moralists who don’t understand the real dangers lurking in Watashuka. Their activities often lead to unnecessary distractions, allowing the true occult forces to operate unchecked.\n\nUnintentional Harm:\nBy focusing on the Metalheads and other harmless expressions of youth rebellion, MOM misses the real threat posed by the cults in town. Their obsession with the Satanic Panic creates an atmosphere of paranoia that allows the true cults—like Church of the Delayed Blossom and Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled—to continue their dark rituals without interference."},"caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline":{"title":"Project Caroline","links":["caroline-college/Events/The-Baptism-of-'39"],"tags":[],"content":"Project Caroline\nA covert operation using Caroline College as a front to investigate supernatural phenomena. Agents are embedded throughout the town.\nOffice of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)\nThe original founding group of Project Caroline. It was founded as a result of investigating The Baptism of &#039;39. Agent Howard Fitzsimmons was the first investigator, and later founder, of the project\nOffice of Technology Assessment (OTA)\n\nThe Office of Technology Assessment took over Project Caroline from the OSRD upon its restart in the mid 70&#039;s. The OTA continues to operate covertly, with Dr. Amy Mann being one of their key assets. The project involves time manipulation, which has inadvertently created a time loop from 1983 to 1987.\n\nThe Time Loop and Project Caroline\nTime Loop (1983-1987)\n\nOverview: Due to the experiments conducted by Dr. Amy Mann under Project Caroline, the universe has become trapped in a time loop spanning from 1983 to 1987. The only way to escape the loop is to rescue Amy Mann, who disappears at the beginning of each loop.\n\nProject Caroline\n\nOverview: A secret government initiative that started during WWII and continues in secret today, overseen by the OTA. The project is focused on studying and controlling supernatural phenomena, particularly time manipulation, with the aim of replicating the abilities of eldritch gods. Many at Caroline College are unaware that the project is still active.\n\nPossible Faction Schemes\nU.S. Government (Project Caroline)\n\n\nTime Loop Experiments:\n\nProject Caroline is continuing time manipulation experiments, hoping to find a way to control the time by exploiting eldritch energy. Their actions attract the attention of the Amish and cultists, who either try to stop or exploit these experiments.\n\n\n\nSurveillance of the Amish:\n\nGovernment agents have begun covertly surveilling the Amish community, suspecting them of harboring knowledge of the supernatural forces at play. This scheme risks tipping off the Amish to the government’s deeper involvement.\n\n\n\nInfiltrating Caroline College:\n\nProject Caroline has placed covert operatives among the faculty and students of Caroline College to monitor and influence ongoing supernatural events. These agents are particularly interested in the activities of the cults, activities at campus location that defy traditional surveillance technology, and any Amish involvement on campus.\n\n\n\nWeaponizing Supernatural Forces:\n\nThe government is experimenting with using eldritch entities and powers as weapons. These efforts occasionally intersect with the cults, who seek to manipulate these same forces for their own ends.\n\n\n\nStudying the Buildings:\n\nProject Caroline is researching select buildings their potential ties to ancient powers. This research draws the attention of both cults, who have constructed or obtain the structures over the decades.\n\n\n\nSuppressing Cult Activity:\n\nThe government is secretly tracking and eliminating high-ranking members of both the Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath cults. However, the cults are becoming aware of this effort and are striking back through more covert means.\n\n\n\nContainment of Eldritch Entities:\n\nProject Caroline is working on containment procedures for the eldritch beings they have encountered. Their containment methods often conflict with the Ho-Chunk and Amish’s own rituals to banish or neutralize these entities.\n\n\n\nManipulating Ho-Chunk Knowledge:\n\nThe government is attempting to exploit the ancient knowledge held by the Ho-Chunk people. They offer technological or financial incentives to extract information but face resistance from the community.\n\n\n\nMonitoring Time Anomalies:\n\nProject Caroline is keeping close tabs on the time anomalies in Watashuka, particularly around Caroline College. Their efforts to fix or control the time loop bring them into conflict with both the cults and the Amish.\n\n\n\nColluding with Cults:\n\n\n\nCertain elements within Project Caroline have begun secretly working with the cult of Yog-Sothoth, believing that aligning with the cult could provide them the edge they need in understanding and controlling eldritch powers.\n"},"caroline-college/Infomation/Real-Basis-For-Locations":{"title":"Real Basis For Locations","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Caroline: Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College\nWatashuka: South of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College"},"caroline-college/Infomation/Summary-of-Literary-Conceits-In-Caroline-College":{"title":"Summary of Literary Conceits In Caroline College","links":["Conceits-(literature)"],"tags":[],"content":"Summary of Literary Conceits\n1. The Small Town with Dark Secrets\n\nConceit: Watashuka appears to be a quaint, struggling small town in rural America—a perfect representation of quiet country life with local institutions like a Lutheran church, a college, and family-owned businesses. Beneath this peaceful façade, however, lies a hidden history of occultism, supernatural occurrences, and government conspiracies.\nEffect: This conceit lures players into a familiar and nostalgic setting, only to slowly reveal its dark underbelly. The contrast between the idyllic rural setting and the creeping horror creates suspense and tension.\nSummary: The familiar Americana setting contrasts with hidden cosmic horror.\n\n2. The Time Loop\n\nConceit: The entire game world is trapped in a time loop spanning 1983 to 1987, caused by a government experiment gone wrong. The loop resets every few years, with only subtle changes each time, while eldritch beings seem to exist outside of or partially immune to its effects.\nEffect: The time loop gives the setting a feeling of repetition and inevitability, as the same strange occurrences and tragedies happen over and over again. It mirrors themes of cosmic futility and existential horror in the works of authors like H.P. Lovecraft, where humans are trapped by forces far beyond their control. For players, it introduces a puzzle-like challenge of breaking the loop to escape the repeating cycles of horror.\nSummary: The repetition of events mirrors themes of cosmic futility and existential dread.\n\n3. The &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; Twist\n\nConceit: The 1980s fear surrounding heavy metal music and role-playing games (the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot;) is flipped on its head. In the world of Watashuka, the very groups accused of promoting devil worship (metalheads, conspiracy theorists, gamers) are actually trying to fight the supernatural forces and protect the town from eldritch horrors.\nEffect: This subverts the expectations of both the characters and the players, who might expect these groups to be involved with the occult. Instead, these so-called &quot;outcasts&quot; serve as unlikely heroes. This twist also plays into themes of paranoia and misdirection, where societal fears are focused on the wrong targets.\nSummary: Metalheads and gamers are actually fighting the real occult forces, subverting 1980s fears.\n\n4. The Conspiracy Theorist Who is Sometimes Right\n\nConceit: Dave, the pirate radio host of &quot;Metal At Midnight,&quot; serves as a wild, paranoid conspiracy theorist whose broadcasts often sound absurd. However, he occasionally stumbles onto real truths about the town’s supernatural history and ongoing conspiracies.\nEffect: Dave embodies the trope of the unreliable narrator, forcing players to sift through his ramblings to find kernels of truth. His role introduces a meta-narrative where players must decide how much of his information to believe, knowing that even a broken clock is right twice a day.\nSummary: Dave’s unreliable narration adds humor and paranoia, with glimpses of truth.\n\n5. The Hidden Power Struggle\n\nConceit: Watashuka is home to multiple factions vying for control, including cults, the government’s secret Project Caroline, and the Amish guardians protecting the world from supernatural forces. Each group operates in secrecy, and their true intentions are often misunderstood by the townspeople.\nEffect: This creates a layered narrative where players are gradually drawn into a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and betrayals. The power struggle adds intrigue to the setting, with each faction hiding behind different facades (religious institutions, academic programs, local law enforcement), feeding the game’s themes of deception and the hidden truth.\nSummary: Multiple factions work in secret, creating a web of deception and alliances.\n\n6. The Mundane Masking the Supernatural\n\nConceit: Ordinary settings and objects (a biology lab, a local museum, a small-town grocery store) are used as fronts for supernatural activity and occult rituals. The familiar becomes the unfamiliar as seemingly benign places turn into sites of cosmic horror.\nEffect: This literary conceit plays with the uncanny, creating unease by blurring the line between the mundane and the supernatural. It heightens the sense of paranoia, as players must question every normal-seeming place or person, wondering if they are tied to the dark forces manipulating the town.\nSummary: Ordinary places hide eldritch rituals, blurring the line between normal and uncanny.\n\n7. The Tension Between Religion and the Occult\n\nConceit: The town’s deeply Lutheran identity is contrasted with the dark undercurrents of occult activity. The Lutheran Church is unaware of the true supernatural threats, mistakenly believing external devil worshipers are the issue while the real danger comes from cultists embedded in their own institutions.\nEffect: This religious dynamic deepens the theme of blindness to hidden dangers. The church&#039;s misunderstanding of the threat reflects how human institutions often fail to perceive or address the true nature of evil. It also taps into the Lovecraftian theme of cosmic forces beyond human understanding.\nSummary: The Lutheran Church misidentifies the true threat, reflecting human blindness to cosmic horror.\n\n8. Cosmic Horror in a Small Scale\n\nConceit: While the stakes involve cosmic entities and eldritch horrors, the setting focuses on small, personal stories—disappearances, strange rituals in biology labs, and eerie occurrences at a local hospital. The vastness of the threat is made more terrifying by how it plays out in an intimate, insular community.\nEffect: This brings cosmic horror down to a human scale, creating a sense of helplessness as ordinary people confront unfathomable powers. The tension lies in how the town&#039;s residents unknowingly live alongside these horrors, oblivious to the full scope of what’s happening around them.\nSummary: Vast cosmic threats play out in an intimate, personal setting, increasing the sense of helplessness.\n\n9. Misinformation and Red Herrings\n\nConceit: The story deliberately uses misinformation, false leads, and red herrings to mislead players and characters alike. Amy Mann’s disappearance, for example, serves as a red herring, diverting attention from the larger ritualistic threat posed by the cults.\nEffect: This conceit adds a puzzle-like quality to the narrative, where players must navigate false clues and layered mysteries. The use of misinformation creates an atmosphere of distrust and confusion, contributing to the theme of hidden truths and conspiracies.\nSummary: Red herrings and false leads create an atmosphere of paranoia and mystery.\n\n10. The Inescapable Past\n\nConceit: The region’s dark history, going back to the destruction of Prairieville Academy, continues to shape the present. The original rituals and occult influence haunt Watashuka, affecting every generation since.\nEffect: This taps into the idea that the past is never truly gone, and that the evil deeds of one generation can ripple through time, affecting those who come after. The repeated cycles of the time loop reinforce this idea, symbolizing the town’s inability to escape its cursed history.\nSummary: The town’s dark history continues to affect the present, symbolized by the time loop and recurring horrors.\n"},"caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College":{"title":"Caroline College","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline"],"tags":[],"content":"Caroline College\nOverview\nOriginally founded as Prairieville Academy, then Prairieville School, the college is a major economic driver for Watashuka.

The academy becomes the heart of the town of Prairieville, which later becomes Watashuka. The academy was the dream of three educators Walter Mann, Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling. There dream was to work with the local Ho-Chunk people to bring forth a new era for the region. That dream is still alive today despite setbacks.\n\nFounding Members\n\nWalter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy\nEleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated\nJohn W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated\nElias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen\nJonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian\nSarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1860 – Destruction of Prairieville Academy\n\nThe academy is destroyed during a violent conflict between the settlers and a rogue native tribe who attacked the school. During the attack many of the educators and founders were killed; only Eleazar Root and John Sterling survived. The academy burned down. Many blame local tensions with indigenous people on the attack. Most records from this time are lost, and it remains a tragic, but poorly understood, event in local history.\n\nSeptember 1862 – Rebuilding of Prairieville School\n\nIn the wake of the academy’s destruction, the Prairieville School is built to continue the region’s educational mission. Under the leadership of Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling the school thrives and grows as part of the effort to revitalize education in the region, attracting settlers to the area. Eleazar served as the school&#039;s first principal while John provided the financial and political support.\n\nBlizzard of 1888 - Humanitarian Aid\n\nAfter the Blizzard of 1888, large numbers of members of the Lutheran Church immigrate to the region. The first settlers arrive to provide humanitarian assistance but soon took to calling the region home.\n\nApril 1895 – Caroline Religious Teaching College Founded\n\nDue to the influence of Lutheran immigrants, the Caroline Religious Teaching College is established, expanding the former school into a larger institution focused on religious education. The town of Prairieville is renamed Watashuka, believed to be derived from a misinterpreted Native American word symbolizing the area&#039;s different cultural influences.\n\n1939-1945 – World War II Efforts\n\nCaroline Religious Teaching College contributes to the war effort, with local industry and students engaging in patriotic duties. The college’s science and engineering departments grow due to wartime funding. After the war, the college continues expanding its academic programs.\n\n1945 – Caroline College Renamed\n\nThe college is officially renamed Caroline College after WWII, reflecting its role as a modern liberal arts institution. The post-war years bring growth and new facilities, including Sister Sarah’s Medical Center, a teaching hospital for nursing and healthcare students.\n\n1969 – Population Decline\n\nWatashuka’s population begins to decline in the late 1960s due to changing economic conditions; notably the closing of several government projects now deemed complete. People start leaving for larger cities like Madison and Milwaukee. The closing of some industries and the general economic downturn are seen as the reasons for this decline.\n\n1983-Present – Present Day Watashuka\n\nWatashuka is a quiet rural town with Caroline College as its centerpiece. The town struggles economically, but the college brings new students and some level of vibrancy. Residents are largely unaware of any significant issues beyond normal small-town troubles.\n\nTown of Watashuka Directory\n{Feel: Small-town America, where even those better off economically are still considered disadvantaged by the standards of most of the country.}\nMain Street\n\nThe Press Newsstand\n\n\n\nOwner: Margaret &quot;Marge&quot; Wilkins, a no-nonsense woman in her late 50s.\n\n\nDescription: Located on Main Street, The Press Newsstand has been a fixture in Watashuka for decades.

Lined with small businesses and family-owned shops, it exudes a nostalgic charm. During the day, it bustles with locals running errands and small talk flowing between shopkeepers and customers. The sounds of typewriters, local radio, and the clinking of glasses at the Blue Heron Pub fill the air. However, as the sun sets, Main Street takes on a different tone. Shadows seem to stretch longer here, and the empty streets echo with an eerie silence. The old brick buildings, now weathered and fading, whisper of past prosperity, but there’s a creeping unease. Those who remain after dark often speak of strange figures seen down alleys, and locked doors that rattle on their own.\nThe side streets add to the town’s atmosphere of quiet decay, with narrow, cobbled roads leading to forgotten businesses like old law firms and shuttered hardware stores. These roads seem darker at night, and there’s a sense that they have stories of their own—stories that no one speaks of openly. The occasional flash of movement in a dimly lit alley is enough to send most people hurrying back to the safety of Main Street’s lights. It’s a place where secrets linger, just beneath the surface of everyday life.\n\nNorthwest &quot;Sterling Hills&quot;\n {Notes: State Route 89 marks the town&#039;s western border} {Feel: Most affluent, not wealthy but doing better than the rest of the town. } \n\n\n\nNorth High School\n\nPrincipal: Mr. Peter Clarke, a stern but fair educator who has been principal for over a decade.\nDescription: As the only remaining high school in Watashuka, North High School is vital to the town’s educational system.

Some believe that cargo occasionally goes missing or arrives mysteriously, adding to the town’s ever-present sense of unease.\n\n\nHomes of Caroline College Faculty and Staff\n\nResidents: Various faculty and staff members from Caroline College, with a mix of younger professionals and older professors who have lived in Watashuka for decades.\nDescription: The homes in this area are modest but well-kept, mostly occupied by college faculty who commute to the campus. Many of these residents prefer to stay out of the town&#039;s more mysterious goings-on, focusing on academic life. However, some of the older professors are rumored to have strange ties to the occult history of Caroline College. The homes here are older, with a sense of quiet respectability, but at night, the streets can feel eerie, as though something is watching.\n\n\nHomes of Government Staff\n\nResidents: Various staff connected to Project Caroline and other secretive government initiatives.\nDescription: On the surface, these homes seem perfectly ordinary, blending in with the rest of the northwest. However, these government workers are often more reclusive, keeping their personal lives secret. It&#039;s not uncommon for new families to move in suddenly without much introduction, and neighbors have learned not to ask too many questions. Strange vehicles are sometimes seen in the area late at night, adding to the suspicion that these residents are involved in something beyond mundane government work.\n\n\n\nOutside of the town limits to the Northwest\n\nCaroline College\n\nAtmosphere\n\nSterling Hills is a peaceful and affluent part of Watashuka, home to Caroline College faculty, government staff, and some of the town’s more well-off residents. The streets are lined with mature trees and stately homes, giving the neighborhood an air of quiet respectability. On the surface, Sterling Hills feels safe and orderly, but there’s an underlying tension among the residents, particularly those with ties to the college or government projects. The silence in the evenings can feel oppressive, and the long shadows cast by the aging street lamps make it easy to imagine something lurking just out of sight.\nCaroline College’s campus stands apart from the town of Watashuka, its stately buildings and green lawns giving it an air of academia and history. But beneath the calm, scholarly exterior lies a deeper mystery. The architecture is imposing, and some of the older buildings seem to hold secrets in their very walls. Students talk about the strange things that happen late at night—flickering lights, unexplained noises, and locked doors that sometimes swing open on their own. The college is the intellectual and economic heart of Watashuka, but many suspect that it also holds the key to the town’s darkest secrets.\n\nNortheast &quot;Farmer&#039;s Ridge&quot;\n {Feel: Very rural, farm focused} \n\nHanson’s Hardware &amp; Building Supplies (Relocated from Downtown)\n\nOwner: Jack Hanson\nDescription: After closing the downtown location, Jack Hanson moved his hardware store to the northeast of town, closer to the rural community it serves. Jack is a gruff but helpful man, always willing to offer advice on home repairs and farming tools.\n\n\nWatashuka Co-Op Farming Supplies\n\nOwner: Co-Operative (Manager: Fred Yoder)\nDescription: A bustling co-op that provides farming supplies to local dairy farmers and crop growers. Fred Yoder, a practical man with deep roots in the Amish community, manages the co-op. The building is large and utilitarian, but always busy.\n\n\nYoder’s Amish Goods Market\n\nOwner: The Yoder Family\nDescription: A rustic market selling handmade Amish goods, including baked items, furniture, and crafts. The Yoders are a quiet but friendly family, well-known for their traditional methods and quality products. The market is a charming wooden structure with a welcoming atmosphere.\n\n\n\nOutside of the town limits to the Northeast\n\nAmish Community Border\nWatashuka Farmers\n\nAtmosphere\n\nFarmer’s Ridge is the agricultural heart of Watashuka, where life revolves around the seasons, livestock, and the land. The area feels timeless, with endless rows of crops and farmhouses dotting the landscape. There’s a peacefulness here, but also a sense of isolation. The farmers are proud and self-reliant, yet the region has begun to experience odd disturbances—animals going missing, strange lights in the sky, and crops failing for no apparent reason. The Amish community nearby maintains a watchful eye, quietly dealing with these unnatural occurrences, while keeping their deeper knowledge to themselves.\nThe Amish lands to the northeast of Watashuka are serene and picturesque, with rolling hills, wide fields, and carefully maintained farms that seem untouched by time. Horse-drawn buggies travel along dirt roads, and the simple wooden homes and barns give the area a peaceful, pastoral quality. The air smells of fresh-cut hay and wood smoke, and the rhythmic sound of hammering and livestock creates a sense of calm industry. Life here feels slower and more purposeful, far removed from the chaos and strangeness that pervades the rest of the town. However, beneath this idyllic surface, there is an undercurrent of tension. The Amish community is quietly vigilant, guarding against the supernatural forces they know are at work in the region. They don’t speak openly about it, but their farms are filled with subtle protective symbols and rituals passed down through generations. The land itself feels ancient, almost sacred, and there are places—groves, streams, and old stone fences—where the air seems heavier, as if the land remembers something older and darker than anyone knows. Visitors often feel watched, though never threatened, and the locals are polite but distant, carefully guarding their secrets from outsiders. At night, the peaceful calm takes on a more unsettling tone. The lantern lights from the Amish homes are the only illumination for miles, and the darkness feels thicker here. Those who venture too far from the main roads speak of strange sounds from the woods—low, guttural noises that no animal should make, and lights flickering in the distance where no homes stand. The Amish lands are a place of quiet strength, but also one where ancient forces are constantly kept at bay.\n \n\nSouthwest &quot;Prairie View Downs&quot;\n {Notes: Corner of State Route 89 and State Route 11 marks the town boarder} {Notes: Boarder of Ho-Chunk native people&#039;s land (further to the south west)} {Feel: Very rural, keep to themselves type people} \n\nK Squared Gas Station\n\nOwner: Kevin and Kyle Kilgore, twin brothers who run the station.\nDescription: Located on the way out of town, heading towards Caroline College, K Squared is more than just a rural gas station. It serves as a morning pit stop for students and faculty on their way to class. In addition to fuel, the store offers coffee, breakfast snacks, and basic supplies. The Kilgore brothers are known for their friendly banter and keeping tabs on the local happenings. Despite their jokes, the brothers have noticed strange shifts in clientele, especially at night, though they stay tight-lipped about any odd occurrences.\n\n\n\n\nAnnie&#039;s Animal and Game Processing Plant\n\nOwner: Annette &quot;Annie&quot; Martin, a tough, no-nonsense woman in her early 60s.\nDescription: Annie’s processing plant serves the rural hunting and farming communities around Watashuka. She processes everything from livestock to wild game for local farmers and hunters. The plant, located just off State Route 89, is a sprawling complex that smells of blood and meat. Annie has worked here her whole life and claims the strange noises she hears from the nearby woods are just the wind, though many of her workers whisper about shadowy figures spotted at dusk. Her knowledge of the land and its history runs deep, though she rarely shares her thoughts on the town’s oddities. She turns a blind eye to the activities that sometimes happen in the slaughter house after hours.\n\n\n\n\nStreamwader&#039;s Hunting Goods\n\nOwner: Jim Watson, a grizzled Vietnam War vet and experienced outdoorsman.\nDescription: Streamwader’s shop is a small, rugged building filled with hunting rifles, bows, traps, and other outdoor equipment. Jim has lived in Watashuka for decades and loves to share his stories with the younger generation of hunters, though his more chilling tales are often dismissed as the ramblings of an old soldier. Despite his outwardly gruff demeanor, he’s a reliable source of information on the wilderness, particularly the Ho-Chunk land and the strange occurrences in the area.\n\n\nRural Communities\n\nResidents: Dairy farmers, crop growers, and livestock ranchers.\nDescription: The sprawling farmland to the southwest is home to families who have lived in Watashuka for generations. These farmers are mostly self-sufficient, and many have an unspoken rule to mind their own business. However, odd crop failures and animal mutilations have been happening more frequently, and locals are growing increasingly uneasy. The rural residents are also wary of government projects and any outsiders, but their tight-lipped nature keeps them from sharing too much with the town.\n\n\nHo-Chunk Information Center\n\nCurator: Mary Whitecloud, a knowledgeable and reserved Ho-Chunk woman in her late 40s.\nDescription: This small center serves as an educational hub about the Ho-Chunk people, their history, and their culture. The building is humble but welcoming, with displays about Ho-Chunk traditions and artifacts. Mary runs the center, offering tours and answering questions from visitors, but she remains guarded about the deeper spiritual knowledge of her people. Only a few trusted individuals are ever told about the ongoing efforts to protect the land from supernatural threats, and the information center serves as a front for some of these activities.\n\n\n\nOutside of the town limits to the Southwest\n\nThe Wet Spot\n\nOwner: “Big” Tony D’Amato, a business-savvy man in his 50s.\nDescription: Despite its seedy reputation, The Wet Spot is a popular hangout for college students, known for cheap drinks and live music. The club, located just outside town limits near Lake Mary, sees far less occult activity than other places in Watashuka. Tony, the owner, loves catering to the college crowd, offering student discounts and hosting wild theme nights. Locals mostly avoid the place, but for Caroline College students, it’s a spot to unwind away from prying eyes. Though rumors swirl about shady dealings, Tony keeps a tight lid on any trouble, preferring to keep things legal—and profitable.\n\n\nBorder of Ho-Chunk Native People&#039;s Lands\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe Downs are a mix of sprawling farmlands and quiet, isolated properties. The air is thick with the smell of fresh hay and the sound of distant tractors, creating a rural, down-to-earth feel. It’s a hard-working community where people keep to themselves and don&#039;t ask too many questions, but lately, even the most stoic farmers have begun to notice strange crop failures and unexplainable happenings. The occasional whiff of something unnatural in the air adds a layer of unease to this otherwise tranquil countryside. The Ho-Chunk lands just beyond the town’s limits only add to the mystery, with many locals choosing to avoid the area at night.\nThe Ho-Chunk lands are sacred and revered, with a strong connection to the spiritual and supernatural forces of the region. The area is quiet, peaceful, and somewhat eerie. The trees here seem older, and the wind carries with it the weight of ancient history. Many in Watashuka avoid this part of the land, either out of respect or fear, but the Ho-Chunk people themselves are watchful, aware of the forces at work both on their land and in the surrounding town. There’s a sense of hidden power here—something deep and old that most people don’t understand but can feel all the same.\n\nSouth East &quot;Lakeview&quot;\n {Feel: Working Class mixes with impoverished housing and abandoned lots}\n {Note: You cannot see the lake from the neighborhood.}\n\nLakeview Elementary And Jr. High School\n\nOwner/Principal: Principal Nancy Doyle, a stern yet caring woman who has run the school for over 20 years, is known for her no-nonsense attitude.\nDescription: The school serves the local working-class families of Watashuka. It&#039;s an aging building, with outdated facilities, but a dedicated staff. Known for its tight-knit community, teachers often go above and beyond to help students who face difficult circumstances at home.\n\n\nMackie Recreational Park\n\nCaretaker: Gary “Old Man” Dutton, a retiree who volunteers his time to maintain the park, always seen with his trusty rake in hand.\nDescription: Once a bustling park for families, Mackie Recreational Park now has overgrown fields and outdated playground equipment. Despite its wear, it’s a gathering place for children after school and hosts occasional community events.\n\n\nBerg Farm House - on empty lot on 14th St.\n\nOwner: Unknown and in dispute. The Watashuka Historical Society is attempting to take ownership but they lack the funds.\nDescription: The oldest surviving building in the region, the Berg Farm House was built before 1876. This is known from a surviving watercolor painting dated from 1876. It is suspected that the structure may have an older origin. The building is currently abandoned and opinions are mixed as to whether the town should restore it or demolish it.\n\n\n19th Street Apartments\n\nOwner: The elusive Mr. Ronald Maddox, a local landlord notorious for neglecting property repairs while still demanding rent on time.\nDescription: A low-income apartment complex filled with diverse residents. The building is run down, with peeling paint and unreliable plumbing, but it&#039;s home for many who can’t afford better housing.\n\n\nJackie&#039;s East Side Pizza\n\nOwner: Jackie Leone, a friendly, middle-aged man with a deep love for pizza (even if he cannot eat it himself due to lactose intolerance). He’s known for giving free slices to kids who can&#039;t afford them in exchange for odd jobs (washing dishes, cleaning, etc.).\nDescription: Known for its greasy, but delicious pizza, Jackie’s East Side Pizza is a local favorite for a quick bite. The interior is simple and clean, with checkered tablecloths and neon signs that have seen better days.\n\n\nDominick&#039;s Grocery\n\nOwner: Dominick Santoro\nDescription: The largest grocery store in the region, it is a family owned store with shelves that are always stocked with local produce and staples. Dominick&#039;s caught between the norms of a simpler time and the pull of the modern world. In a struggle to stave off outside commercial interests, the pull of the modern is winning.\n\n\nCobblers &amp; Threads\n\nOwner: Betty Whitehall, a no-nonsense seamstress, and her brother Frank Whitehall, the cobbler. They’ve run the shop together for decades, known for their efficient teamwork.\nDescription: A dual-purpose shop offering both shoe repair and clothing alterations. Known for its fast service, it’s a favorite for residents who want to make their clothes and shoes last a little longer.\n\n\nTony’s Barber Shop\n\nOwner: &#039;Little&#039; Tony McKivett\nDescription: A classic barber shop where the men of Watashuka gather for haircuts and town gossip. Tony’s father ran the shop before him, and Tony knows just about everyone’s secrets. The shop has old-fashioned leather chairs and a timeless feel.\n\n\nNickel Quick-Mart\n\nOwner: Rick Graves, a friendly, overworked man who runs the store mostly on his own. He’s known for always greeting customers with a smile despite the long hours.\nDescription: A small, rundown convenience store that carries everything from snacks to household items. It’s open late and frequented by everyone in the neighborhood for last-minute purchases.\n\n\nMetal Circle Apartments\n\nOwner: Martha Hale, a widow who inherited the building from her late husband and struggles to keep it maintained on her own.\nDescription: A small apartment complex, known for its circular layout which follows what was once the boundary Prairieville. The apartments are affordable but come with frequent maintenance issues. It&#039;s popular with students from Caroline College looking for off campus housing.\n\n\n\n\nAnderson&#039;s Shady Tree Mechanics and Auto Sales\n\nOwner: Jed Anderson, a gruff but likable mechanic who’s been fixing cars in Watashuka for as long as anyone can remember.\nDescription: A combination auto repair shop and used car dealership, located just on the road out of town. It’s known for doing quick, cheap repairs and offering used cars at prices that make people suspicious. The junk yard in the fields behind the shop are expansive.\n\n\n\n\nMid-City Apartments\n\nOwner: Marie Jennings, a tough but fair property manager who tries to do what she can with the limited resources she has.\nDescription: A crumbling, multi-story apartment building. The elevator is always broken, and the halls are filled with peeling wallpaper. Despite this, it’s always full of tenants; especially the town&#039;s aging population who do not have family to stay with.\n\n\n3 Ball Pawn\n\nOwner: Roy “Three Ball” Smith, a shrewd businessman who claims he can sell anything.\nDescription: A dark, cramped pawn shop filled with odd trinkets, used electronics, and questionable items. The shop is always busy, with people haggling over prices. It has frequently in trouble with local law enforcement for selling items with a &#039;questionable&#039; past.\n\n\nPR’s (Poor Richard’s) Bar\n\nOwner: Richard “Rich” Mulligan, a man whose nickname, Poor Richard, comes from his tendency to drink away his own profits.\nDescription: A local dive bar with a dimly lit interior, cheap drinks, and live music that is popular with college students.\n\n\nCornerstone Center (Community Center)\n\nManager: Clara Williams, a passionate social worker who does her best to keep the center running with limited funds.\nDescription: A rundown community center that offers free classes and activities for local kids and adults. The building is in desperate need of repairs, but it’s still a hub for the neighborhood.\n\n\nWatashuka Chamber of Commerce\n\nHead: Alan Peterson, an optimistic businessman who believes Watashuka’s best days are still ahead, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\nDescription: The town’s business association, housed in a small, non-descript building. The Chamber tries to encourage economic development, but the town’s declining fortunes make it an uphill battle.\n\n\nPeach Street Library\n\nLibrarian: Sly Coolstein\nThe Peach Street Library is the only public library in town. While the number of volumes available are limited, they do cover a wide range of topics not usually found in a rural town library. This is due to the donations of enthusiasts in the region.\n\n\nGarrison &amp; Sons Law Office\n\nOwner: Jack Garrison and Sons (Ted and Wayne)\nDescription: A family-run law office, Garrison &amp; Sons handles wills, property disputes, and other local legal matters. Jack is semi-retired, leaving much of the day-to-day work to his sons, Ted and Wayne. The office is a small, simple building with old wooden floors and dusty bookshelves.\n\n\n\nOutside the town limits to the Southeast: &quot;Lakeview Shores&quot;\n {Feel: Resort attractions that have seen better days.}\nOnce a thriving vacation destination, Lakeview Shores has seen better days. Nestled along the edge of Lake &quot;View,&quot; this aging resort area was once popular with families seeking outdoor recreation, but a combination of economic decline and neglect has left it in a state of disrepair. The area is now frequented by locals, campers, and the occasional nostalgic visitor, though the glory days are long gone.\n\nSit n&#039; Eat Diner and Motel\n\nOwner: Doris Larkin, a friendly but world-weary woman in her 60s who runs the place single-handedly.\nDescription: This diner and attached motel are classic roadside Americana, with faded neon signs and a cracked parking lot. Once a bustling stop for tourists, the rooms are now sparsely occupied, and the diner serves mostly local regulars. Despite the wear and tear, Doris keeps the food hot and the coffee flowing. The motel rooms are clean but dated, with décor that hasn’t been updated since the 1970s. It’s a quiet place to rest—aside from the occasional strange sounds coming from the lake at night.\n\n\nThe Lake (Public House)\n\nOwner: Tom &quot;Big T&quot; Lawson, a burly man in his 50s with a passion for local history and cheap beer.\nDescription: The Lake is a weathered lakeside tavern that once thrived on summer tourism. Now, it’s mostly filled with locals looking for a cheap drink. The tavern has a large deck overlooking the water, though the view is often shrouded in mist, adding an eerie ambiance. Inside, fishing trophies and old photos of Lakeview’s heyday decorate the walls. Big T is always ready to share stories of the lake’s supposed mysteries, though most patrons dismiss them as drunken ramblings. It is almost never visited by college students and is considered a &#039;locals only&#039; establishment. &quot;Its the only place in town where a good Lutheran can get a drink.&quot;\n\n\nLakeside RV Park &amp; Campground\n\nOwner: Marty and Sue Briggs, an aging couple who have managed the site for over 30 years.\nDescription: The RV park and campground sit on the fringes of Lakeview Shores, offering both short-term and long-term stays. Once a vibrant vacation spot, the campground now attracts a more transient crowd, with only a handful of RVs and tents set up at any given time. The facilities are outdated but functional, and the lake’s shoreline is overgrown with weeds. Marty and Sue keep the place running, though they worry about strange sightings around the lake at night—especially the eerie lights that appear near the water.\n\n\nAll Wet Market &amp; Deli\n\nOwner: Jane and Bob Wheeler, a friendly couple in their late 40s trying to revive the area.\nDescription: This small market and deli caters to the remaining campers, RV dwellers, and the few vacationers that still trickle in. Despite the area’s decline, Jane and Bob are optimistic and do their best to offer fresh sandwiches and snacks, even though their stock sometimes sits for weeks before being sold. The building is quaint but worn, with a cheery atmosphere inside. Some locals say the market is the last “normal” place in Lakeview Shores, untouched by the area’s growing strangeness.\n\n\nLakeview Lakeside Fun Center (Mini Golf &amp; Arcade)\n\nOwner: Dave and Cathy Arnold, a laid-back couple in their 50s who refuse to let the place die.\nDescription: The Lakeview Fun Center was once a bustling family attraction, complete with mini golf, an arcade, and boat rentals. These days, the mini golf course is overgrown, and most of the arcade machines are out of order, save for a few that still function—barely. Dave and Cathy are known for their easygoing attitudes, keeping the place open even if it only gets a few visitors a day. There’s a haunted feeling to the abandoned games and rusting golf obstacles, but the Arnolds shrug it off, insisting it’s all in good fun.\n\n\nThe Playhouse on the Lake\n\nOwner: Nancy Bright, a former actress who settled down after her career ended.\nDescription: This small theater once hosted local plays, musicals, and live performances for vacationers. Now, it’s mostly abandoned, with only a few amateur productions each year. Nancy, an eccentric woman with a flair for the dramatic, still dreams of restoring the theater to its former glory, though few share her enthusiasm. The Playhouse is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former actor who died during a performance, but Nancy waves off such rumors with a smile.\n\n\nThe View New Age Shop\n\nOwner: Lucinda &quot;Luce&quot; Moore, a free-spirited woman in her 40s with a deep interest in the supernatural.\nDescription: This small, quirky shop offers crystals, tarot readings, and other New Age paraphernalia. Luce is one of the few people in Lakeview Shores who embraces the strange energy of the area, and she’s always ready to discuss local legends or offer advice on warding off spirits. The shop is popular with college students and visitors interested in the occult, though locals are often skeptical of Luce’s claims about the lake’s mystical powers. She’s known to host moonlit gatherings by the lake, though only a few daring souls ever attend.\n\n\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nDespite its decline, Lakeview Shores holds a certain charm for those who appreciate faded beauty and quiet reflection. However, there’s an undercurrent of mystery and neglect here. The lake, once a source of joy, now seems shrouded in fog and whispers of the unknown. Locals and visitors alike can’t shake the feeling that something is lurking just beneath the surface, but most choose to ignore the oddities in favor of nostalgia and the hope that this forgotten resort town might one day return to its former glory. Once a bustling summer retreat, Lakeview Shores has an air of forgotten grandeur. The overgrown paths, weathered motels, and silent campgrounds hint at better days, but now the area feels haunted by time. The lake itself is shrouded in mist more often than not, and strange things are said to happen at night—lights on the water, eerie sounds, and the occasional disappearance. Despite its decline, Lakeview Shores retains a nostalgic charm for those who remember its heyday, but visitors and locals alike can’t shake the feeling that something is lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered.\nLakeview is a working-class neighborhood with a sense of faded optimism. Many of its residents are struggling to make ends meet, and the area’s rundown houses and overgrown lots are signs of its slow decline. Yet, there’s a strong community spirit here, where neighbors help each other out, and children still play in the streets. The boarded-up windows and crumbling facades tell the story of a once-thriving part of town, but the people hold onto hope that better days are coming. There’s also a growing sense of paranoia—whispers about things lurking in the shadows, and unexplained phenomena that people try their best to ignore.\n"},"caroline-college/Metal-At-Midnight-Shows/Black-Lake":{"title":"Black Lake","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Metal At Midnight: Black Lake\n{WCTU is interrupted by static and electrical interference.}\n{Dave laughing maniacally}\nOhhhh yeah! It’s time to wake up, sleepyheads! This is your friendly neighborhood madman, DAVE, comin’ at ya live with another episode of Metal at Midnight! And tonight, bro, I got somethin’ that’s gonna melt your mind faster than a Sabbath riff at double speed!\n{Cue heavy metal track – “Specter at Dawn” by Nightstalker, featuring eerie riffs and relentless drumming.}\nSo, while all you fresh meat have been worrying about your first exams and dodging campus security, I’ve been out here diggin’ deep into the stuff THEY don’t want you to know. And tonight, we’re taking a little trip off the beaten path, away from our cozy little Watashuka... Let’s talk about somethin’ I call… the Black Lake Incident.\n{Static and ominous feedback}\nYeah, that’s right, bro. Ever heard of it? Probably not, ‘cause THEY made sure to bury it deeper than your last biology grade. Picture this: out in the middle of nowhere, deep in the northern woods—there’s a lake. But it’s not just any lake. It’s dark, man. Too dark. Black Lake. Real original name, right? But this place? It ain’t like your summer camp getaways. No... locals say it’s cursed.\n{Distant, echoing whispers}\nBack in ‘79, a whole group of people—locals, hikers, campers—went missing there. Like, vanished off the face of the earth. And here&#039;s the kicker: it wasn&#039;t just the people. Their cars, their tents, their gear, ALL of it just… gone. The lake? It swallowed them whole, bro. And there’s no record of an official investigation. Oh sure, they’ll tell you it’s just another ‘urban legend,’ but when was the last time an urban legend came with classified government files?!\nNow here’s where it gets really freaky. Word on the wire is that Project Blacklight, some super-secret government operation, was sent in to clean it all up. But they didn’t just show up with your run-of-the-mill troops, no, no, no. They sent in special forces—paranormal specialists. Yeah, that’s right, bro. The kind that deal with things that go bump in the night.\n{Ominous drumming in the background}\nLocals claim they saw military trucks rollin’ in, all blacked out. No lights, no sound. And get this—ever since that night, anyone who tries to camp near Black Lake ends up with the same nightmare. They wake up, choking, gasping for air, like something’s pulling them down. Drowning them. Like the lake is alive, bro. They say you can still hear the whispers if you listen close enough. But hey, I’m just your friendly neighborhood conspiracy nut, right?\nAnd here’s where it gets even weirder. Rumor has it there’s some kind of ancient artifact buried deep beneath that water. Something older than time, man. Maybe the lake was always cursed, maybe it’s something else entirely. But one thing’s for sure, whatever they found there in ‘79, the government has been doing everything it can to cover it up.

You’ve heard the whispers, the stories your parents won’t talk about. But there’s one incident that most of you’ve probably never even heard of, ‘cause it was scrubbed clean. Erased. Until now.\n{Static crackles}\nEver heard of the Stratton Mill Fire? No? Yeah, they like it that way. It happened ten years ago, October 1973, and they’ve been keeping it under wraps ever since. That’s right, folks. Stratton Mill, one of the oldest buildings in town, went up in flames one chilly autumn night. But here’s the kicker… no one saw it burn. No one.\n{Ominous guitar riff building in the background}\nI know, I know, sounds like I’m making it up, right? A whole building burns down in the middle of town, and no one notices? But let me tell ya, there’s a reason for that. The fire wasn’t normal. It didn’t happen like you’re thinkin’. I dug deep, bro—old records, whispers from the few old-timers who still remember. And guess what? The fire was cold.\n{Screeching feedback, then dead silence for a beat}\nYeah, you heard me. Cold fire. It burned, but the temperature dropped. People near the mill that night reported seeing blue flames and hearing this weird hum, like a vibration in the air. Some folks claim they saw shadowy figures walking into the fire like they were just taking a Sunday stroll. But here’s where it gets really freaky… there were no bodies. And when they found the building the next morning? Not even ash, man. Just… gone.\nNow, here’s where it gets juicy. My sources tell me that the town’s finest, including our favorite boy in blue, Sgt. Jan Ducochik, have been diggin’ into this for years. What they’re not tellin’ you is that there were three people missing that night—three workers who were never found. But the mill owners? They just quietly shut the whole thing down, and any record of it? Poof! Erased like it never happened.\nNow, why would they go to all that trouble, huh? What’s so special about a little old mill burning down? Well, here’s a theory for you. The Stratton Mill wasn’t just a place for grinding grain. It was a meeting place for some real shady characters—people who dabbled in things they shouldn’t have. Rituals, man. Dark ones. And those ‘figures’ walking into the cold fire? They weren’t running from it. They were walking into it to disappear.\n{Cue another heavy track – “The Haunter” by Death Mask, with eerie vocals and fast, thrashing guitars.}\nNow, the official story, if you dig deep enough, says that there was a &#039;minor structural collapse&#039; at the mill and that it was abandoned afterward. No big deal, right? But you won’t find any real records from the town on it. No fire report, no insurance claims, nothing. Why? Because they’re scared, bro. Scared of what really happened that night. And scared of what might still be hiding underneath those ruins.\n{Sound of papers shuffling and Dave laughing under his breath}\nHere’s a little nugget for you truth-seekers out there… I got wind that our good sergeant has been poking around the mill site again. It’s all locked up now, fences and all, but something—or someone—has been stirring things up over there. And it ain’t just rats in the walls, bro. So if you’re feeling brave, why not take a little midnight stroll to the Stratton Mill ruins and see for yourself?\n{Sound of Dave tapping on the microphone}\nJust don’t be surprised if you feel a chill in the air that’s got nothin’ to do with the weather. And hey, if you start hearin’ that hum? Run, dude. Run fast. ‘Cause whatever’s still hiding at the Stratton Mill… it’s cold, and it’s hungry.\n{Music picks up – “Veil of Shadows” by Spectral Abyss, heavy and atmospheric, filled with dread.}\nAlright, metal militia, time for me to disappear into the night before THEY try to shut me down again. Keep your ears to the ground, your minds sharp, and your amps cranked. And remember… truth is colder than fiction.\n{Outro guitar fades out into static}\nTill next time, freaks. Stay metal, stay alive.\nBroadcast cuts out with a final screech of static as WCTU’s regular programming attempts to resume."},"caroline-college/NPCs/Amy-Mann":{"title":"Amy Mann","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline","caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom"],"tags":[],"content":"Dr. Amy Mann (Ph.D. Physicist, Government Operative)\n\n\n\nBackground: Dr. Amy Mann is a prodigy, having completed her doctorate in temporal physics by the age of 21. Recruited by the Office of Technological Assessment (OTA) right out of graduate school, she has been sent to Watashuka under the guise of a faculty member at Caroline College. Her groundbreaking research on time manipulation is of great interest to Project Caroline, which seeks to exploit the ley lines for military use. Unbeknownst to her, Amy&#039;s work is directly tied to the eldritch forces lurking beneath the town.\n\n\nAge: 23 (1983)\n\n\nAppearance: Amy&#039;s striking presence is one of grace and intelligence. She has delicate yet determined features: fair skin with a soft glow, large expressive blue-green eyes framed by long lashes, and golden-blonde hair that cascades in soft waves. Despite her brilliance, she maintains an air of innocence and naivety about the world beyond academia. Amy often dresses in professional yet understated attire, favoring dark, minimalist outfits with sharp collars, as if her clothing reflects the precision of her scientific mind.\n\n\nPersonality: While exceptionally intelligent and focused, Amy is quiet and introspective, preferring the company of her research over socializing. She tends to be reserved, avoiding unnecessary attention, but is passionate about solving the mysteries of time and the universe. Her curiosity is both her greatest strength and her undoing, as it leads her deeper into the occult forces she doesn’t fully comprehend. Despite her genius, in 1983, she has a vulnerable side—being so young, Amy is still somewhat naïve about the political and supernatural machinations surrounding her.\n\n\nConnections:\n\nProject Caroline: Amy was recruited by the OTA to work on secretive government experiments tied to time manipulation and the ley lines beneath Watashuka. Her research is invaluable to the project, though she is unaware of the true extent of the eldritch entities that influence both her work and the town.\n\n\n\nFate: Amy disappears on August 29, 1983, after witnessing a ritual by Church of the Delayed Blossom. Her disappearance is the catalyst for the time loop that resets the town’s reality every few years. In each cycle, Amy’s fate is sealed—whether she is killed, pulled into another dimension, or sacrificed. She unknowingly serves as the temporal anchor for the loop, her life and death entwined with the supernatural forces at play.\n\n\nRole in the Time Loop: As the anchor, Amy is crucial to breaking the loop. Players may encounter echoes of her throughout different cycles, or even uncover fragmented memories she has left behind in the form of notes, messages, or recorded experiments. If they can save her or prevent her disappearance, they might find a way to disrupt the cycle—though doing so may unleash even greater dangers.\n\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nMissing Person: Investigators can be drawn into the mystery by following leads related to her disappearance, piecing together her connection to Project Caroline and the cults.\nPersonal Journals: Amy’s research journals, scattered throughout Watashuka, contain clues not only to her scientific work but also to the rituals and cults operating around her. Some pages may hold cryptic notes that reveal her growing awareness of the loop.\nVisions and Dreams: Amy may appear to players in dreams, fragmented across time, desperately trying to warn them about what’s to come. These visions often carry a sense of urgency but are incomplete, leaving the players to fill in the blanks.\n\n\n\nFinal Goal: Breaking the time loop requires either rescuing Amy from her fate or successfully completing the temporal experiments that trapped the town in the first place. However, even if she is saved, the eldritch horrors may still find a way to break through the fabric of reality.\n\nIf the cults ever break free from the time loop and are able to complete their ritual, which must happen on 23 Feb 1987, just as a new light source in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) reaches Earth, they will awaken their &#039;original god&#039;. What they do not understand is that this &#039;original god&#039;, Cthulhu, will, as a first act, wipe out all of the cults... then the region, then the world.\nThis happened in at least two iterations of the time loop\n\nAmy initiated the time loop on purpose to stop such an event with the hope that she and her team could disrupt the ritual from ever being able to be completed. Unfortunately, her presence at a major cult ritual became the anchor for one end of the loop; her initiating it became the other. She is stuck at the two ends of the loop unable to warning anyone about the dangers our the consequence of failure.\n\n\nEach iteration of the time loop shuffles the initial conditions and as such people, places and events may change. But each campaign starts with a ritual that Amy is present for, and her disappearance shortly after that. If Amy&#039;s disappearance could be stopped, the time loop is broken. But the players would still have only a few years to stop the final ritual.\n\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Captain-Bernard-Miller":{"title":"Captain Bernard Miller","links":["caroline-college/NPCs/Sgt.-Jan-Ducochik","caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/NPCs/Michelina-Plum"],"tags":[],"content":"Captain Bernard Miller (Watashuka Police Captain, Secret Keeper, and Reluctant Leader)\n\nRole:\nCaptain Bernard Miller serves as the head of the Watashuka Police Department, a position that places him in the town’s spotlight more often than he would like. He is known around town for his womanizing persona, often boasting about his romantic escapades in nearby Madison and telling exaggerated stories of past conquests. In truth, Bernard hides a very different reality—he is secretly gay and uses his reputation with women as a cover to conceal his true orientation. He often spends his off hours traveling to Milwaukee, where he immerses himself in the more vibrant and discreet gay bar scene.\nAppearance:\nBernard is a ruggedly handsome man with a strong build, giving him an imposing presence that complements his role as captain. He wears his police uniform with an air of confidence, and his neatly styled brown hair and clean-shaven face give him a polished appearance. Despite his outwardly tough and composed demeanor, Bernard’s eyes often betray a deeper sadness, one that hints at the internal conflicts he struggles to keep hidden. Off-duty, Bernard dresses sharply, particularly when traveling to Milwaukee, where he allows himself to relax in ways he never can in Watashuka.\n\nAge: (1983): 44\n\nPersonality:\nBernard is a man caught between two worlds, and the stress of maintaining his double life weighs heavily on him. In Watashuka, he projects an image of bravado, charm, and masculinity, playing up his womanizer act to distract others from his true orientation. Behind the scenes, however, he is deeply closeted and feels isolated by the conservative environment of the town. He drinks heavily, often turning to alcohol as a way to escape both the pressures of his personal life and the strange happenings in town that he tries to ignore. Bernard is not a bad man, but his self-preservation instinct has led him to avoid conflict, particularly when it comes to dealing with the occult phenomena that others in the police force—like Sgt. Jan Ducochik—are starting to investigate.\nPublic Role:\nWatashuka Police Force: As the captain of the Watashuka Police Department, Bernard is the face of law enforcement in the town. His leadership style is hands-off, preferring to delegate most of the actual police work to his officers while he remains more of a figurehead. Town leadership, particularly those with ties to cult activity, often pressure him to shut down or suppress any investigations that could expose the darker forces at work in Watashuka. Bernard, eager to maintain his comfortable position and avoid trouble, often complies, directing his officers to avoid digging too deep into unexplained disappearances, cult rumors, or strange events. This has put him at odds with more diligent investigators, particularly Sgt. Ducochik, whose persistence often annoys Bernard.\nSecrets:\n\nSexual Orientation: Bernard has gone to great lengths to keep his true sexual orientation a secret, cultivating his image as a womanizer to deflect suspicion. He regularly leaves Watashuka under the pretense of visiting Madison, but in reality, he heads to Milwaukee, where he frequents the gay bar scene. These trips provide him a rare sense of freedom, but he is always careful to maintain his cover, knowing that if the truth were to come out, it would not only destroy his personal life but also jeopardize his position as police captain.\n\nRelationships:\n\nMichelina Plum: Bernard has a complicated relationship with Michelina Plum, the late-night DJ at WCTU. She is one of the few people in town who knows the truth about his trips to Milwaukee, having accompanied him on a few occasions. In return, Bernard keeps Michelina’s more decadent interests under wraps, ensuring that any rumors about her private life don’t reach the wrong ears. Their connection is mutually beneficial, though Bernard feels a constant undercurrent of tension around her, knowing she holds one of his deepest secrets.\nSgt. Jan Ducochik: While Bernard respects Sgt. Ducochik&#039;s skills as an investigator, he finds Jan&#039;s constant probing into the town’s stranger cases to be a threat to the delicate balance he’s maintained with town leadership. Bernard is often pressured by higher-ups, many of whom are involved in the cults that manipulate the town, to stifle any investigation into occult activity. As a result, Bernard frequently undermines Ducochik’s efforts, brushing off unusual cases as mere “coincidences” or “unsolvable mysteries.” The captain&#039;s passive stance on the town’s eerie occurrences frustrates Ducochik, who sees Bernard as weak and complicit.\n\nAttitude Towards Occult Activity:\nBernard actively avoids dealing with the supernatural elements that are slowly creeping into the town. He knows something is wrong in Watashuka, but he is terrified of confronting it, both out of fear for his own safety and because it would require him to engage in investigations that could reveal things better left alone. His strategy is to ignore the strange events, hoping that they’ll go away on their own—or, failing that, to let someone else deal with them while he focuses on maintaining his personal façade.\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nHidden Allies: If investigators dig into Bernard’s personal life, they could discover his trips to Milwaukee and his connection to Michelina Plum. This could be used to either blackmail Bernard into helping them or to offer him a lifeline, pulling him into an alliance if they can prove their trustworthiness.\nSquashing Investigations: Bernard’s involvement in shutting down investigations could become a roadblock for players trying to uncover the truth about Watashuka’s cults. They may need to find ways around his interference, or they could attempt to win him over by appealing to his sense of guilt and self-preservation.\nPressure from Above: As players unravel more of the town’s secrets, they may find that Bernard is being used as a pawn by the town&#039;s elite. If pushed too hard, Bernard might finally snap, either turning to alcohol even more heavily or taking drastic action to free himself from their control.\n\nPublic Perception:\nMost of Watashuka sees Bernard as a charming, albeit somewhat lazy, police captain who spends more time talking about his conquests than actually leading the department. His womanizing reputation keeps most people from suspecting the truth about his personal life, though there are occasional rumors about his absences and frequent trips to Milwaukee. His hands-off approach to police work is generally tolerated because the town has not yet fully descended into chaos—though if things continue to get stranger, Bernard may find himself in over his head."},"caroline-college/NPCs/Cthulhu":{"title":"Cthulhu","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"caroline-college/NPCs/Dave":{"title":"Dave","links":["caroline-college/NPCs/WCTU"],"tags":[],"content":"Dave (&quot;Metal At Midnight&quot; Host)\n\n\nName: Unknown (only referred to as &quot;Dave&quot;)\nRole: Pirate radio host of the show Metal At Midnight\nBroadcast Frequency: Hijacks WCTU\nShow Time: The show is very sporadic. When it does air, it starts exactly at midnight and runs until it gets cut off. Metal At Midnight has never ran past 6:14 am.\nPersonality: Dave is a paranoid conspiracy theorist, blending metal music with rants about government surveillance, cults, and supernatural forces. His ramblings often contain pieces of truth, but they are wrapped in layers of wild theories, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. He is energetic, often sidetracked, and uses stoner slang like &quot;bro,&quot; &quot;man,&quot; and &quot;dude.&quot;\nBeliefs: Convinced that shadowy forces (cults, the government, secret societies) are tracking him. He sees himself as a voice for the oppressed and the counterculture, using metal music as a form of rebellion. Dave regularly mocks the satanic panic of the 1980s, claiming the real evil is something far worse, lurking beneath the surface in Watashuka.\nAppearance: No one knows what Dave looks like. Despite efforts to trace his broadcast, neither the authorities nor the college have located his signal. Some suspect he could be a former student or professor, or even an outsider hiding in the town’s outskirts.\nPurpose: Dave’s rants, though erratic, often contain cryptic hints about the supernatural events in Watashuka. His listeners—especially metalheads—may pick up on these clues, though they have to decode his chaotic monologues to find useful information. He may also have insight into the time loop or Project Caroline, though he doesn’t fully understand what he’s uncovered.\nMannerisms: Known for laughing maniacally during his broadcasts and jumping between topics, often blending real-world events with conspiracy theories. He distrusts everyone, especially those in positions of authority.\n\nRole in the Game:\n\nSource of Information: Dave’s broadcasts can help players uncover clues about the supernatural events in Watashuka, but his unreliable narration means players must sift through his rants for useful information.\nConnection to the Occult: Although he mocks the satanic panic, Dave inadvertently exposes the town’s real occult activity. He sees himself as a rebel fighting against shadowy forces but doesn’t fully realize the depth of the dangers he uncovers.\nRallying Point: Dave serves as a symbol of rebellion for the town’s metalheads and outcasts. His pirate broadcasts encourage youth counterculture and inspire them to push back against the town’s more conservative forces.\n\n\nRumors About Dave:\n\nThe Ghost Broadcaster: Some say Dave died in a car accident years ago and now broadcasts from beyond the grave using old radio frequencies.\nAn Old Professor: A popular theory is that Dave is a disgruntled former professor from Caroline College, who left after being involved in occult studies.\nIn League with the Cults: Some claim Dave is a cultist, using his broadcasts to send coded messages to his followers.\nA Rebel Student: Others believe Dave is a current student using the college’s equipment to host his show without the administration’s knowledge.\nGovernment Spy: A few conspiracy theorists think Dave is actually an undercover agent for Project Caroline, using his show to monitor the town.\nLives in the Tower: There’s a rumor that Dave broadcasts from Qubit Tower, hiding in its old, unused rooms.\nThe Forgotten Son: Another rumor suggests Dave is the illegitimate child of a prominent family, using his show to exact revenge.\nAmish Defector: Some speculate Dave fled the Amish community and now rebels against the strict traditions he grew up with.\nA Dark Ritual Survivor: A few believe Dave was the sole survivor of a failed occult ritual in the 1970s and now uses his show to expose Watashuka’s supernatural underbelly.\nA Figment of Imagination: There are those who insist that Dave doesn’t exist, and &quot;Metal at Midnight&quot; is simply a hallucination broadcast by the ley lines themselves.\n\nExamples of Dave Lines:\n\n\nIntro: &quot;Hey, hey, hey, midnight marauders! This is Metal At Midnight, comin&#039; at ya live from...well, you don’t need to know where, bro. Let’s just say I’m somewhere those government goons can’t find me, but I know they’re listening. ‘Cause THEY always are, man. But hey, screw ‘em! Let’s get into some Sabbath to start your night right—this one goes out to all the truth-seekers, dude.&quot;\n\n\nOn Supernatural Events: &quot;So, check this out, man...there’s been some freaky stuff goin’ down in this town for a long time. Like, way longer than anyone talks about. I’m talkin’ weird symbols, secret meetings at night, and I swear, I saw someone in a black robe hanging out near that creepy old slaughterhouse. They don’t want you to know, but I do. The truth’s out there, man!&quot;\n\n\nHeavy Metal and the Occult: &quot;You know what gets me, bro? These squares think metalheads are worshiping the devil or whatever. But no way, man! We’re the ones fighting back against the REAL dark stuff. We got the music, we got the guts, and we’re not bowing down to whatever weird cult crap is really goin&#039; on. Up the irons, bro! And now, let’s hear some Maiden!&quot;\n\n\nParanoia: &quot;And before you ask, NO, I’m not givin’ out my location, man! &#039;Cause THEY are out there, waiting. Yeah, that’s right—I see you, you shadowy government spooks, tryin’ to shut me down. But you can’t! Not as long as the metal keeps playin’, man.&quot;\n\n\nOn the Strange Calls Michelina Gets: &quot;Oh, and shoutout to that WCTU chick, Michelina—she’s got someone messin’ with her, and I KNOW who it is, but I ain’t sayin’ yet. Just know, she’s in deep, and whoever’s callin’ her? Not from this world, bro. You gotta be careful with that stuff.&quot;\n\n\nIdeas for Future Shows:\n&quot;Spooky Science? Or Something More Sinister?&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: The players’ investigation into the biology lab might result in rumors spreading about strange happenings during the lab exercises. Perhaps students gossip about freaky occurrences, unusual sounds, or even the feeling that the classroom was &quot;haunted&quot; during the dissection.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;So, listen up, man... I got word that some of you little lab rats had a real spooky time in bio class last week. You think that dissection was just frogs and microscopes? Think again, bro. There’s more going on in those biology labs than your teachers are letting on. Strange symbols, weird feelings in the air… Hell, I bet it’s all part of some crazy ritual, man. Yeah, they’re slicing more than frogs in there, bro—keep your eyes peeled for anything that looks too weird. And if you see those symbols? RUN.&quot;\n(Plays Slayer’s “Angel of Death”)\n\n\n&quot;Where’d the Valley Girl Go?&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: Rumors about Amy Mann’s disappearance spread across campus. Students may have seen her acting suspiciously before vanishing or noticed undercover agents pretending to be campus police poking around her dorm.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Yeah, so check this out… that valley girl who’s been making the rounds at Caroline College? Word on the street is she’s gone—like, poof, vanished. Cops showed up, but you know as well as I do that they’re not telling us everything. What was she into? Who was watching her? Could it be… THEY? Keep your head on a swivel, kids. It’s always the ones you least expect.&quot;\n(Plays Iron Maiden’s “Stranger in a Strange Land”)\n\n\n&quot;There’s Something Rotten in Bio Lab!&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: As players continue to investigate, strange phenomena tied to the failed or ongoing ritual might be reported, such as flickering lights, eerie sensations, or even rumors of supernatural activity. Students might whisper about feeling cold spots or hearing whispers in the bio lab after the players’ first encounter.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Yo, listen up, bro! Word from the inside says things have been getting real weird in that biology lab. Lights flickering, shadows moving where they shouldn’t be, and a couple of students claiming they heard whispers when no one else was there. I’m telling you, man, something went down there—something big. They’re trying to cover it up, but the truth always gets out, man. So if you’ve got a class in that lab? Watch your back.&quot;\n(Plays Metallica’s “Creeping Death”)\n\n\n&quot;Class Dissected, Reality Warped&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: Students gossiping about a failed lab experiment or the freaky occurrences during the ritual’s climax could reach Dave’s ears. His conspiracy-obsessed mind would exaggerate the events, weaving them into a narrative about secret government experiments or occult rituals.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;So get this, man... word is that some kinda ritual went wrong in the biology lab last week. Yeah, you heard me right—a ritual, bro. And no, it ain’t your regular science experiment. I’m talking symbols, weird lights, and things levitating, dude. You know what that means, right? They’re messing with forces they don’t understand. You feel that chill in the air? That’s not just bad AC, bro—that’s reality tearing at the seams.&quot;\n(Plays Black Sabbath’s “Into the Void”)\n\n\n&quot;The Vanishing Frog and the Not-So-Innocent Sub&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: Rumors spread about the strange behavior of the substitute teacher leading the biology class. Maybe students noticed their odd jewelry (occult symbols) or overheard cryptic phrases related to the ritual. Dave could latch onto this, suspecting the sub is tied to the cult or the government.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Okay, so like, check this out... that sub in the bio lab? They’re not who they say they are. I’ve heard rumors that they’re sporting some real freaky jewelry—occult stuff, man. And they’re always muttering weird things under their breath. Yeah, I know—it sounds nuts, but I’m telling you, THEY are hiding something. They’re in on the ritual stuff, bro. And the way they were running that lab class? Totally sus. Watch out for them—they’re more than just a teacher.&quot;\n(Plays Judas Priest’s “Breaking the Law”)\n\n\n&quot;Amy’s Ghost? Or Something Worse?&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: After Amy Mann’s disappearance, rumors of sightings or eerie phenomena around campus—possibly tied to her undercover work or the supernatural—might start to circulate. People might claim to have seen Amy’s figure at night, but her behavior seems off.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Yo, this is a wild one... some folks are saying they’ve seen that valley girl walking around at night, but she’s not acting like herself, man. Like, spooky stuff—shadows flickering, people hearing her voice when she’s not around. Is it a ghost? A doppelgänger? Or maybe she’s got caught up in something way worse. Either way, bro, keep your eyes peeled. If you see her, don’t get too close.&quot;\n(Plays Ozzy Osbourne’s “Bark at the Moon”)\n\n\n&quot;The Bio Lab Conspiracy&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: Students might talk about the weird energy or lingering effects after the ritual’s failure (or success). The idea that the biology lab is &quot;haunted&quot; or cursed could spread through campus, and Dave would latch onto this, weaving it into his conspiracy theories.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;So, there’s this buzz goin&#039; around... the bio lab’s been off ever since that thing went down last week. People are saying the room’s haunted or cursed. Like, bro, I’m telling you, it’s not just your usual science mishap. They’ve got rituals going on in there, and whatever they were summoning? It’s left a mark. The walls remember, man. The lights flicker for a reason. That room ain’t safe anymore.&quot;\n(Plays Iron Maiden’s “Fear of the Dark”)\n\n\n&quot;Cover-Up at Caroline!&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: If the players uncovered some evidence of a connection between the biology lab and the cult (or even Project Caroline), Dave might get wind of the university or local authorities trying to cover it up. His broadcast would reflect his growing paranoia about hidden forces at work.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;You think the school’s lookin’ out for you? Wrong, bro. Word on the street is they’re covering up whatever went down in that lab. And the local cops? Yeah, they’re in on it too. The truth is, this goes way deeper than some missing valley girl or a botched dissection. We’re talkin’ full-blown conspiracy to hide whatever the hell they were trying to summon. Keep digging, and maybe you’ll find the real truth. Just don’t let THEM find you first.&quot;\n(Plays Megadeth’s “Hangar 18”)\n\nThe Nighttime &quot;Dumpster Operation&quot;\nWhat Dave Hears: Someone may witness or overhear players sneaking into Sister Sarah’s Medical Center or spot strange activity near the hospital. They might hear rumors of unusual late-night trash collection or strange behavior around the dumpsters, especially if the players disturb or investigate the area during their adventure.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Dumpster Divers, Dude! I heard from my ‘sources’—yeah, you heard me right, sources—that some of you metalheads have been snoopin’ around Sister Sarah’s. I’m tellin’ ya, it’s no joke. Weird stuff’s goin&#039; on after midnight, and I KNOW they’re throwin’ away more than used bandages. Trash gets picked up late at night, and it’s not your average garbage, man. I’ve seen the shadows move... too clean for comfort! Maybe they’re takin’ out more than trash. You’re brave, but don’t get too close, or you’ll end up on their hit list.&quot;\n(Metallica’s “Disposable Heroes” fades in for dramatic effect)\n\n\nBizarre Hospital Sightings\nWhat Dave Hears: Someone hears that the players encountered something disturbing or supernatural inside the hospital—whether it’s shadowy figures, inexplicable screams, or evidence of experiments. The players might spread rumors or slip details to a local, which eventually reaches Dave.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;The Bleach-Clean Hellhouse!&quot; &quot;So, I hear some of you’ve gotten brave and checked out ol’ Sister Sarah’s at night. The things you saw, huh? Shadows that move weird, patients that ain’t exactly... alive anymore? Some of you vets know what I’m talkin’ about—screams in the night, bodies moved in and out faster than you can say &#039;medical malpractice.&#039; You ever wonder what’s really happenin’ back there? Well, wonder no more, man—it’s like a sci-fi slasher flick, but you’re IN IT. Just be careful, ‘cause THEY don’t want anyone talkin’.&quot;\n(Plays Black Sabbath’s “Into the Void” as the music break)\n\n\nMissing Staff or Patients\nWhat Dave Hears: Someone in town starts gossiping about missing hospital staff or patients after the players’ investigation. Maybe the players rescued someone, or they uncovered something that led to hospital staff disappearing or being relocated by the cult. The community may notice staff turnover or unexplained absences.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Vanishing Acts at Sarah’s!&quot; &quot;You ever notice how people just... disappear? Yeah, like staff at Sister Sarah’s, man. Heard from a reliable source that some of the nurses and docs there just up and vanished. Or maybe it’s the patients? Hard to keep track. One minute they’re there, next minute—poof!—gone. It’s like magic, bro, except darker and creepier. You think they just quit? Nah, THEY know something we don’t. I bet they’re cleaning up their mess, and trust me, it ain’t bandages and bedpans they’re throwin’ out.&quot;\n(Plays Judas Priest’s “Beyond the Realms of Death”)\n\n\nIncreased Security at Sister Sarah’s\nWhat Dave Hears: After the players&#039; investigation, security might increase at Sister Sarah’s Medical Center. Whether it’s more guards, stricter visitor rules, or rumors of the hospital becoming more secretive, locals might talk about how it’s harder to get in or how the staff seems more on edge.\nDave’s Broadcast:\n\n&quot;Watch Your Back at Sarah’s!&quot; &quot;Heard from one of my night owls that security at Sarah’s has ramped up big time.

Dexter has been hiding in Watashuka since the 1880s, as he is being hunted by a Hound of Tindalos. The cults’ influence has kept the hound from entering the town, but Dexter remains paranoid. To the town’s residents, Dexter is a normal bookstore owner who has been running the family business for generations.\n\nDexter Colby, having lived in Watashuka since the 1880s, would need to be particularly clever and meticulous in maintaining his cover. Over the decades, he has likely employed a number of subtle strategies and crafted convincing stories to prevent suspicion. Here are some methods Dexter might use to keep his true identity hidden from the town&#039;s residents:\n1. Frequent Name Changes (Within the Family Line)\n\nDexter cycles through different variations of his name, claiming to be different generations of the &quot;Colby&quot; family. Every few decades, he might introduce himself as &quot;Dexter Colby Jr.&quot; or &quot;D. Colby,&quot; telling the town that the bookstore has been passed down from father to son. He regularly updates the store&#039;s business license and paperwork to reflect these generational changes.\nStory: &quot;My father started this bookstore, and now I&#039;m keeping the family tradition alive.&quot;\n\n2. &quot;Out-of-Town&quot; Trips\n\nDexter occasionally claims to travel for long stretches of time to visit family or pursue rare book acquisitions. During these absences (which could range from several weeks to even a year), people don’t notice the passage of time as much. He might return with tales of far-off places, lending to his mystique while providing an excuse for any perceived changes in appearance or behavior.\nStory: &quot;I&#039;ve just returned from Europe, hunting down rare first editions for the shop. It&#039;s good to be back.&quot;\n\n3. Low Profile and Private Life\n\nDexter purposefully avoids being the center of attention. He doesn’t attend community events, weddings, or funerals regularly, and when he does, he blends in and leaves quickly. By not becoming deeply involved in personal relationships, most people see him as a slightly reclusive bookworm, which suits his low-key lifestyle.\nStory: &quot;I prefer to keep to myself—books are my real friends.&quot;\n\n4. Claiming to Age Slowly (Family Trait)\n\nDexter can explain his youthful appearance as part of a long-lived family, where members tend to age more slowly than others. He downplays any concerns about his lack of visible aging by referencing distant relatives who also lived into their 90s while looking younger than their years.\nStory: &quot;My family has always been blessed with good genes. I guess I’m lucky to take after my grandmother—she still looked 50 at 80.&quot;\n\n5. Strategic &quot;Retirement&quot; and &quot;Reopening&quot;\n\nEvery few decades, Dexter might &quot;retire&quot; briefly, closing the shop or handing it off to a fictional family member. During these periods, he rebrands himself slightly and then reopens the store under the guise of a new &quot;generation&quot; of Colbys. Any residents who question this shift are told that the &quot;new&quot; Dexter is simply a younger relative.\nStory: &quot;I’m the nephew of the original Dexter. I’ve inherited the store after my uncle’s retirement.&quot;\n\n6. Sparse Historical Record\n\nDexter is cautious about keeping minimal public records, avoiding excessive paperwork or social engagements that could leave too much evidence. He might pay in cash, avoid the use of modern banking systems, and steer clear of situations that could tie him to past eras.\nStory: &quot;I prefer to keep things simple—no need for too much bureaucracy in running a small shop.&quot;\n\n7. Limiting Photographs and Public Appearances\n\nDexter subtly avoids being photographed or attending public events where photographs might be taken. He’s been known to &quot;not look right in pictures&quot; and has a knack for subtly dodging photos, making sure there’s little visual evidence of his presence over the years.\nStory: &quot;I’ve never been one for photos—I’m not very photogenic, and I feel out of place in them.&quot;\n\n8. Friends in the Right Places\n\nOver the years, Dexter has befriended certain individuals who may unknowingly help shield him from suspicion. These could be local officials, clerks, or even older residents who simply vouch for him as an upstanding, long-term resident. By fostering goodwill with select town members, Dexter creates a network of people who never question his longevity.\nStory: &quot;Old Mr. So-and-So always spoke highly of the Colby family—he knew them better than anyone.&quot;\n\n9. Fostering Misinformation\n\nOccasionally, Dexter might encourage rumors about his family or store that explain any oddities. For instance, some residents might think he had a reclusive brother or uncle who ran the shop during times when Dexter disappeared. Over time, these rumors become part of the town’s lore, helping mask any inconsistencies in his story.\nStory (spread by town gossip): &quot;Did you hear? I think it was Dexter’s uncle who was in charge of the store back in the 1920s. They’ve always kept the business in the family.&quot;\n\n10. Claiming Ancestral Ties to the Town\n\nDexter often refers to old photographs or documents (which he could easily forge or acquire) to establish a history of his family in Watashuka. The town might have a rich history, but Dexter has been careful to claim that his family has been tied to the town’s growth, making it believable that the Colby lineage has been around for generations.\nStory: &quot;The Colbys have been here since the town was Prairieville Academy. We’ve always been part of Watashuka’s history.&quot;\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Hungry-Ones":{"title":"Hungry Ones","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Ho-Chunk"],"tags":[],"content":"Hungry Ones\nName for Eldritch beings among the Ho-Chunk"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Leonid-Kuznetsov":{"title":"Leonid Kuznetsov","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/NPCs/Randolph-Tomaszewski","caroline-college/NPCs/Ronnie-Regan"],"tags":[],"content":"Leonid &quot;Lenny&quot; Kuznetsov\n\nRole/Title:\n\nNight Stock Boy at Dominick&#039;s Grocery;\nUnwilling Recruit of Church of the Delayed Blossom\n\nBrief Description:\nLenny, as he prefers to be called, is a lanky and unkempt 18-year-old with greasy black hair and a perpetual scowl. His eyes are a dull blue, and his skin appears sallow from years of late nights and poor diet. He often wears a stained Dominick&#039;s apron over threadbare clothes, giving him an overall disheveled appearance.\nBiography:\n\nBackground: Lenny was born to a Russian immigrant family who moved to Watashuka when he was young. His mother left the family when he was just a child, leaving him and his older brother, Sasha, to be raised by their abusive father. As a result of these hardships, Lenny developed a deep-seated resentment towards authority figures and a tendency towards violence.\nMeeting Randolph: Lenny encountered Randolph Tomaszewski at Dominick&#039;s Grocery when he found Randolph stealing food, supplies and animals fresh from the slaughter house meant for the butchers. Randolph, recognizing Lenny&#039;s violent tendencies and the potential for manipulation, decided to recruit him into the Church of the Delayed Blossom.\n\nPersonality:\n\nAggressive: Lenny is prone to outbursts of anger and violence, often directed at those he perceives as weaker than himself.\nManipulative: He enjoys exercising power over others and will often use intimidation or force to achieve his goals.\nSelfish: Lenny prioritizes his own needs and desires above all else, with little regard for the well-being of others.\n\nRelationships:\n\nRandolph Tomaszewski recruited Lenny. Randolph is Lenny&#039;s mentor and controller. Lenny resents Randolph&#039;s control over him but also fears the consequences of defying his orders. This leads to a complex dynamic between them, as Lenny struggles against his cult duties while seeking opportunities to assert his independence. Despite his resentment, Lenny remains loyal to Randolph due to their shared experience of both being controlled by cult.\nRonnie Regan is the subject of Lenny&#039;s unhealthy crush. Ronnie does not know about Lenny&#039;s interest and Lenny is not ready to make his dark fascinations known to others; especially Ronnie. But he has been stalking her secretly.\n\nGoals:\nLenny&#039;s primary goal is to amass power and influence within Watashuka, allowing him to exact revenge on those who have wronged him or his family. As Lenny becomes more aware of the cult&#039;s true nature, he is beginning to hope to break free of Randolph&#039;s control."},"caroline-college/NPCs/Max-and-Maxine-McElhenney":{"title":"Max and Maxine McElhenney","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College"],"tags":[],"content":"Max and Maxine McElhenney\n\nMax McElhenney\nOverview:\nMax McElhenney is a 19-year-old who returned to Watashuka with his twin sister Maxine after inheriting their parents’ old house. Though he enrolled in Caroline College at 18, he put his studies on &quot;hold&quot; and now works as a janitor at the local hospital. Max is laid-back and reserved, often perceived as a stoner due to his slow speech and distant demeanor, even though he’s never touched drugs in his life. This misconception has become a running joke among his co-workers and the town’s youth. Max is an avid heavy metal fan and a loyal listener of Metal at Midnight. He plays the drums and frequently practices with his sister, Maxine. Despite his seemingly carefree exterior, Max harbors a dark secret tied to his family’s past.\nPublic Perception:\nTo most of Watashuka, Max is the quiet, brooding type who seems to be drifting through life. People often dismiss him as &quot;wasting his potential&quot; after leaving college, though his consistent work at the hospital has gained him a reputation as a reliable, if peculiar, employee. Some think he’s hiding from something, but no one can quite figure out what.\nFamily:\nMax and Maxine share a family name, McElhenney, tied to the local Journalism School. Their name is constantly mispronounced, much to their irritation. Their parents died in a car accident when they were just 5 years old, under mysterious circumstances. They were sent to live with family outside of Wisconsin, only to return at 18 when they inherited their childhood home.\n\nMaxine McElhenney\nOverview:\nMaxine McElhenney is Max’s twin sister, and unlike her brother, she has stayed in school. At 19, she’s continuing her education at Caroline College, pursuing a degree in sociology. She’s intelligent, sharp-witted, and often keeps her emotions in check, but shares Max’s passion for heavy metal. Maxine plays the bass guitar, and though she and Max practice together, she has always envied the local Metalheads, longing to belong to their group but never quite fitting in. Like her brother, she is haunted by the mysterious death of their parents, though she hides her deeper feelings behind a composed exterior. Despite her driven academic focus, Maxine harbors a secret that even Max doesn’t know.\nPublic Perception:\nMaxine is seen as the more &quot;successful&quot; twin, continuing her education and working hard. Professors and students alike appreciate her intellect, though she often keeps others at arm’s length. Despite her academic achievements, Maxine seems disconnected, as if she’s always carrying some weight on her shoulders. Her heavy metal interests and aloof personality make her both intriguing and intimidating to her peers.\nFamily:\nMaxine and Max share the McElhenney name, famously tied to the journalism school at Caroline College. She’s as tired as Max of people mispronouncing it. Their parents’ untimely death and the air of mystery around it have left both twins with more questions than answers, though Maxine has tried to focus on her studies to avoid thinking about it.\n\nWhat Really Happened to Their Parents\nMax and Maxine’s parents died in a car accident in Watashuka when the twins were just 5 years old. What really happened is far darker than what was reported. Their parents had become deeply entangled with a local cult, The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, which was conducting dangerous experiments on time and dimensional manipulation. The McElhenneys were trying to escape the cult’s grasp when they were killed in a staged accident meant to silence them.\nWhy the Twins Were Spared:\nMax and Maxine were spared from the cult’s reach because they were still too young to understand the rituals their parents were involved in. However, there’s an eerie detail: the cult intended to use them later. The accident wasn’t a random tragedy; it was orchestrated to remove the parents while keeping the children alive for future use in a ritual that hasn’t yet come to pass.\n\nMax’s Dark Secret\nMax’s Secret: Though Max plays dumb and goes along with the stoner rumors, he’s not as aloof as he seems. Max has begun remembering strange dreams from his childhood, dreams where he recalls his parents taking part in occult rituals. He hasn’t told anyone, not even Maxine, because these dreams imply that he was involved, even as a young child, possibly as a vessel or participant in these rituals. He’s terrified that whatever happened to his parents is somehow connected to him, and that the cult might still be watching.\n\nMaxine’s Dark Secret\nMaxine’s Secret: Maxine maintains a calm, controlled demeanor, but she’s secretly been investigating her parents&#039; deaths on her own. What she’s uncovered scares her: her family’s lineage goes back to some of the original founders of Watashuka’s darker elements, including those tied to the Journalism School that bears their name. What Maxine doesn’t tell Max is that she’s found hidden journals of her parents in the attic of their childhood home, which outline the cult activities they were involved in. She hasn’t told him because she’s considering using the knowledge herself—a thought that horrifies and fascinates her.\n\nProfessions and Skills\n\n\nMax McElhenney\n\nOccupation: Hospital Janitor\nSkills: Stealth, Listen, Drums (Art)\nConnections: Hospital staff, late-night workers\nHobbies: Drumming, heavy metal, practicing with Maxine\n\n\n\nMaxine McElhenney\n\nOccupation: College Student (Sociology)\nSkills: Library Use, Bass (Art), Psychology\nConnections: Professors, classmates, student groups\nHobbies: Playing bass, research, collecting records\n\n\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Michelina-Plum":{"title":"Michelina Plum","links":["caroline-college/NPCs/Dave","caroline-college/Factions/Metalheads","caroline-college/Factions/Mothers-Opposing-Metal","caroline-college/NPCs/Sgt.-Jan-Ducochik","caroline-college/NPCs/Captain-Bernard-Miller","caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka"],"tags":[],"content":"Michelina Plum (Nighttime DJ, Conservative Front with a Dark Side)\nRole:\nMichelina Plum is the host of Night Vibes, a late-night radio program on WCTU, Caroline College&#039;s AM radio station. Her show runs from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., where she plays soothing instrumental music and classical tracks, aiming to calm the nerves of late-night listeners and students. Despite her on-air professionalism and calm demeanor, Michelina hides her decadent personal life and disturbing experiences behind a conservative, pro-Reagan front. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1980 with a degree in Media &amp; Broadcasting and quickly secured her position in Watashuka after moving to town.\nAppearance:\nMichelina is an attractive woman in her mid-30s with a glamorous yet somewhat disheveled look that hints at her hidden vices. Her striking red hair, styled in loose waves, frames her sharp features and bright green eyes. She is almost always seen in silky, low-cut blouses, which give her an air of sultry confidence. Michelina’s Southern drawl, though subtle, comes through when she lets her guard down, particularly when she’s drinking or around people she knows well. On air, she projects a smooth, calm voice, contrasting with her wild side behind the scenes.\n\nAge (1983): 36\n\nPersonality:\nMichelina is a master of double lives. On the radio, she presents herself as a reserved and composed DJ, speaking in a soft, reassuring voice that keeps her listeners company through the lonely hours of the night. However, off-air, she is a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking woman with a sharp wit. She has a secret life, involving alcohol, swinging, and other vices that she keeps hidden behind a conservative public persona. Michelina is also highly political, frequently expressing her admiration for President Reagan and conservative values, but these views are at odds with her personal life. She despises the local counterculture, particularly Dave and the Metalheads, and she is a vocal member of Mothers Opposing Metal (MOM).\nDisturbing Calls:\nSince early 1982, Michelina has been receiving eerie, anonymous phone calls at 2:15 a.m. during her broadcasts. The caller speaks in a strange, guttural language that she initially assumed to be a Middle Eastern dialect. The reality is far more sinister—the language is of mythos origin, and the calls leave Michelina deeply disturbed, though she cannot understand their meaning. Despite reporting the issue to Sgt. Jan Ducochik, the police have been unable to trace the calls, leaving Michelina increasingly paranoid and unsettled. These calls have grown to symbolize the darker undercurrent in her life, adding to her secret fear that something is watching her.\nPublic Role:\nMichelina presents herself as an upstanding, conservative member of the Watashuka community. She is vocal in her support for Mothers Opposing Metal, often speaking out against the town&#039;s growing counterculture. She openly dislikes Dave, the pirate radio DJ behind Metal at Midnight, once even being overheard wishing him dead. Michelina views him and the Metalheads as dangerous influences on the youth and blames them for the town’s moral decline.\nHidden Connections:\n\nCaptain Bernard Miller: Michelina is one of the few people in town who knows the truth about Captain Bernard Miller and his secretive, out-of-town trips. She has even accompanied him on a few of these excursions, though she keeps their nature strictly to herself. Whether this is part of her hidden life or something darker is unclear, but it ties her to the deeper, more sinister aspects of Watashuka.\nMothers Opposing Metal (MOM): Despite her personal vices, Michelina is a proud and active member of MOM. She sees it as a way to keep up her conservative appearance and distract others from noticing her own lifestyle. Her role in the group is mainly organizational, helping to plan protests against Jack&#039;s Surfer or rallies against &quot;satanic&quot; influences in town.\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nThe 2:15 A.M. Calls: Investigators could trace the mythos calls that have been haunting Michelina during her show. These calls might hold the key to understanding a deeper connection to the supernatural forces at play in Watashuka.\nDouble Life: Michelina’s hidden lifestyle offers plenty of secrets for investigators to uncover. Her ties to Captain Bernard Miller and her personal vices may provide insights into the darker undercurrents of the town, especially if players dig beneath her conservative facade.\nMOM Involvement: Michelina&#039;s role in MOM makes her an influential figure in town, and her strong anti-metal stance could put her at odds with certain characters or players. Investigators might leverage her conservative influence to gather support or turn her against others, though they would need to avoid triggering her volatile temper.\n\nPublic Perception:\nMost of the town sees Michelina as a respected, conservative figure—an intellectual who has succeeded in her career and upholds traditional values. Her involvement in MOM and support for Reagan cement her place among Watashuka’s more conservative residents. However, those who interact with her more personally, especially after hours, know that her true personality is far less composed, and her life is far from the picture-perfect image she portrays."},"caroline-college/NPCs/Norm-Habersham":{"title":"Norm Habersham","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/NPCs/Sgt.-Jan-Ducochik"],"tags":[],"content":"Norm Habersham (Senior Editor of The Prairie and Veteran Investigator)\n\n\n\nRole: Norm Habersham is the senior editor of The Prairie, Watashuka’s local newspaper. He has worked at the paper for over 30 years, steadily gaining the respect of the town as a reliable, no-nonsense journalist. Norm is a WWII Navy veteran who returned to Watashuka after the war and dedicated himself to chronicling the town’s history. Though many see him as simply a part of the town’s old guard, Norm harbors a secret: he is investigating the strange and unexplainable events happening in Watashuka, working closely with Sgt. Jan Ducochik  to uncover the supernatural influences that seem to be corrupting the town.\n\n\nAge: Mid-60s (1983)\n\n\nAppearance: Norm has the look of a man who has lived through the rigors of both war and decades of small-town journalism. His graying hair is neatly combed, but his once-strong physique has softened with age, though his blue eyes still carry a sharpness that reflects his keen intellect. He typically wears simple, functional clothing—button-down shirts and slacks that are practical for both the newsroom and his late-night investigations. Despite his age, Norm still moves with purpose, a relic of his military days. He’s rarely seen without a notebook and pen in hand, ready to jot down any useful information, whether for an article or his private investigations.\n\n\nPersonality: Norm is calm, methodical, and sharp-witted. His decades of journalism have given him an instinct for sensing when something is wrong, and his wartime experiences have left him unflappable in the face of danger. He’s a man of few words, preferring to let his investigations and writing speak for him. Norm values truth above all else and has a deep sense of duty to the town, believing that the truth—however strange—must be exposed if Watashuka is to be saved from the dark forces that have taken root. Though he works closely with Sgt. Ducochik, Norm is even more careful than the sergeant, often advising caution and urging Ducochik to avoid making rash decisions that might attract unwanted attention.\n\n\nPublic Role:\n\nEditor of The Prairie: As the senior editor of Watashuka’s main newspaper, Norm wields considerable influence over what the town reads and understands about itself. He carefully curates the paper’s stories, often downplaying the more bizarre incidents in favor of more conventional news. This is not out of fear but strategy—Norm knows that too much exposure too soon could spook the wrong people. He uses the paper as a tool for indirect investigation, publishing subtle hints or coded references to supernatural events that only those in the know might pick up on.\nCommunity Fixture: To the town, Norm is an old, reliable presence, a man who has seen it all and keeps things running smoothly at the paper. He is respected, if somewhat overlooked, as someone who has been around for so long that people take his work for granted. This suits him perfectly, as it allows him to conduct his investigations without drawing suspicion.\n\n\n\nInvestigating the Supernatural:\n\nNorm has been quietly compiling information on the strange happenings in Watashuka for years. He has access to decades of town archives, personal contacts, and a wealth of institutional knowledge that gives him a unique perspective on the town’s dark undercurrents. Norm’s journalistic instincts drive him to document everything, from strange symbols to unexplained disappearances, though much of it never makes it to print. His partnership with Sgt. Ducochik allows him to pursue leads within the police department, while Norm uses his connections at the paper to dig up clues that official channels miss.\nNorm takes a low-key approach to investigation, preferring careful observation and documentation over direct confrontation. He believes in slowly building a case until the evidence is overwhelming, then exposing the truth in a way that can’t be ignored. His caution often balances out Ducochik’s more headstrong tendencies, making them a formidable, if unlikely, team.\n\n\n\nLoneliness and Dedication:\n\nNorm has never married and has no close family, something he attributes to the demands of both his work and the war. His dedication to uncovering the truth has been his life&#039;s focus, and though this isolation has made him more self-reliant, it has also left him with few close relationships. His bond with Ducochik is perhaps the closest thing to friendship he has, though it is built more on mutual respect and shared purpose than personal camaraderie.\nDespite his solitary existence, Norm has no regrets. He sees his role as a protector of the town’s truth, believing that his work will ultimately benefit the community he cares for—even if it means living in the shadows to do so.\n\n\n\nKey Relationships:\n\nSgt. Jan Ducochik: Norm and Jan work closely together, sharing information and coordinating their investigations into Watashuka’s supernatural events. Norm respects Jan’s determination, but he is often the one to caution the sergeant when Jan’s suspicions or paranoia threaten to get the better of him. Norm serves as the more strategic and measured investigator, focusing on gathering concrete evidence while letting Jan handle the more dangerous fieldwork. Together, they form a strong partnership, though Norm sometimes worries that Jan’s intensity will draw unwanted attention to their efforts.\nThe Town&#039;s Leadership: Norm has a complicated relationship with Watashuka’s leadership. While he has maintained a professional relationship with many of the town’s elites over his decades at The Prairie, he has grown increasingly wary of their actions. He knows that some of them are complicit in covering up or benefiting from the town’s darker elements, and he uses his position to subtly investigate them without directly confronting them—yet.\n\n\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nHistorical Records: Norm’s deep knowledge of the town’s history, coupled with his access to newspaper archives, makes him a valuable ally for any investigator seeking to uncover patterns in the supernatural events. He has access to records going back decades, which may hold the key to unraveling the mystery of Watashuka’s strange occurrences.\nSilent Ally: Norm is an ideal ally for investigators who prefer a more discreet approach. He can provide guidance, information, and leads without drawing attention to himself or the investigators. His cautious nature makes him an excellent resource for those looking to stay under the radar.\nThe Hidden Journalist: If investigators push too far or draw too much attention to Norm’s activities, they may find that Norm has been keeping his own files on them. His journalist’s instinct to document everything might become a double-edged sword, and his alliance with the investigators could be strained if they endanger his carefully cultivated cover.\n\n\n\nPublic Perception: Norm is seen as a reliable, almost invisible fixture in Watashuka’s daily life. The townspeople respect him as the editor of their local paper, but most see him as little more than an aging journalist who writes about local events and keeps the community informed. Few suspect that Norm is anything more than what he seems, which is exactly how he wants it. His ability to blend into the background makes him one of the most well-positioned investigators in town, quietly gathering the information others overlook.\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Nyarlathotep":{"title":"Nyarlathotep","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"caroline-college/NPCs/Professor-Katherine-Coates":{"title":"Professor Katherine Coates","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College","caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline","caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/NPCs/Dave","caroline-college/Factions/Metalheads"],"tags":[],"content":"Professor Katherine Coates (Head of Journalism at Caroline College, Idealist with Blind Spots)\n\n\n\nRole: Professor Katherine Coates is the head of the Journalism Department at Caroline College, where she also serves as the faculty advisor for The Crier, the college’s student-run newspaper. A passionate idealist, Katherine believes deeply in the power of journalism to expose corruption and hold institutions accountable. She suspects that some level of governmental corruption is affecting the college, but she remains unaware of the true depth of the government’s activities on campus. She assumes that Project Caroline ended long ago and dismisses rumors of ongoing secretive experiments or cult involvement as unfounded conspiracy theories. Ironically, by attempting to protect the integrity of the department and her own reputation, she has unknowingly become a part of the problem—often covering up the existence of the pirate radio station broadcasts from WCTU out of embarrassment, further distancing herself from the truth she so desperately seeks.\n\n\nAge: Mid-30s (1983)\n\n\nAppearance: Katherine Coates has a distinctive look that matches her intellectual nature. She has short, curly dark hair, wears large round glasses, and often dresses in practical, slightly vintage-style clothing, favoring patterned blouses and cardigans. Her appearance suggests someone deeply engaged in academic life—focused on ideas rather than appearances. Her calm, serious expression reflects her constant state of thought and introspection. She exudes an unassuming air, and while she might seem approachable to students, there’s an underlying intensity to her idealism.\n\n\nPersonality: Katherine is driven by a strong sense of justice and believes in the ethical power of journalism. She pushes her students at Caroline College to investigate stories that expose corruption, inspire change, and give voice to the voiceless. However, her idealism often blinds her to the deeper and more dangerous forces at play in Watashuka. She is particularly frustrated by the pirate radio broadcasts that come out of WCTU, seeing them as a stain on the journalism department&#039;s reputation. To maintain her pride, she has begun downplaying or outright denying their existence, not realizing that in doing so, she’s becoming a source of misinformation—exactly what she despises in others. Katherine’s desire to protect her department’s image overrides her instincts, causing her to miss key clues about the strange occurrences happening around campus and the town.\n\n\nPublic Role:\n\nHead of Journalism Department: Katherine runs the journalism department with an iron focus on ethics and investigation, encouraging her students to dig deep and challenge authority where necessary. Under her guidance, The Crier has earned a reputation for hard-hitting journalism—at least within the confines of campus life. She is proud of the work the students produce and fiercely defends the department’s reputation from internal and external criticism.\nOverseeing WCTU: As the faculty advisor responsible for the campus radio station, Katherine is particularly frustrated by the ongoing pirate radio broadcasts. These underground shows have become a thorn in her side. Katherine has made several attempts to silence the broadcasts, believing them to be nothing more than juvenile acts of rebellion. In her attempts to suppress the problem, however, she inadvertently mirrors the authoritarian tendencies she loathes in corrupt governments, often denying to administrators and others that the pirate broadcasts even exist.\n\n\n\nInvestigating Corruption: Katherine suspects that something is not right at Caroline College, but her investigations into this suspected corruption remain shallow. She assumes the problems are merely governmental—perhaps related to funding mismanagement or outdated agreements with former military projects. She doesn’t yet understand that the forces she’s up against are far more dangerous and intertwined with occult activities happening under the radar. Her belief that the Project Caroline experiments ended long ago has left her unprepared for the deeper horrors at play.\n\n\nInteraction with Watashuka:\n\nInteractions with Students: Katherine is deeply involved in the lives of her students, often acting as a mentor and role model. She encourages them to pursue truth, even when it’s uncomfortable, and her open-door policy makes her popular among those in the journalism department. However, her idealism sometimes causes friction with students who are more interested in sensationalism or entertainment. She sees herself as a protector of the journalistic craft, which can put her at odds with those who view journalism as more of a business or career than a calling.\nTension with Dave: Katherine is very vocal about her disdain for Dave and his pirate broadcasts. She sees him as reckless and irresponsible, a figure who undermines the integrity of the journalism program. This tension has created a somewhat adversarial relationship between her and the Metalheads community, though she remains unaware of the depth of their involvement in the town’s supernatural struggles.\nCovering for WCTU: In her attempts to protect the department’s image, Katherine has gone as far as to deny the existence of the pirate broadcasts to other college administrators, claiming that any complaints about the broadcasts are baseless. She believes that by quashing the controversy, she is protecting the reputation of the journalism program. This puts her in the uncomfortable position of inadvertently spreading misinformation—a role she would detest if she realized the full extent of her actions.\n\n\n\nHobbies and Interests:\n\nLiterature and Philosophy: Outside of her work at the college, Katherine is an avid reader of both classic literature and philosophical works. She spends much of her free time studying texts on ethics, truth, and justice, often incorporating these ideas into her lectures. She particularly admires figures like Hannah Arendt and George Orwell, authors whose works focus on the dangers of corruption and totalitarianism—though she is blind to how some of these critiques may apply to her own behavior.\nArchival Research: Katherine enjoys sifting through historical records and archives, both for personal interest and to find stories for her students. This hobby, however, is more academic than investigative; while she uncovers interesting facts about the town and its history, she doesn’t delve deep enough to see the larger, darker forces at work.\nWalking in Nature: Katherine often takes long walks through Watashuka’s parks and nearby woodlands, enjoying the quiet solitude. These walks allow her to clear her mind and reflect on her work, though she often feels uneasy when alone in the woods—an unexplained discomfort she tends to dismiss as stress.\n\n\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nUnintentional Obstacle: Katherine could become an unintentional obstacle to investigators trying to expose the truth about Watashuka’s supernatural undercurrents. Her efforts to cover up pirate broadcasts or downplay student rumors could mislead investigators or slow their progress, as she inadvertently shields the deeper corruption she hasn’t yet uncovered.\nA Source of Information: Once her trust is earned, Katherine could be a valuable ally, especially given her knowledge of journalism, ethics, and corruption. Her access to historical records and her academic connections could help investigators piece together parts of the mystery. However, convincing her of the supernatural truth will be a significant challenge, as she’s resistant to accepting anything outside of rational, governmental corruption.\nPotential for Growth: As events in Watashuka escalate, Katherine’s idealism could either become a strength or lead to her downfall. Investigators might have the chance to push her to open her eyes to the deeper, more sinister forces at play, or they might find themselves working around her if she stubbornly refuses to see beyond her own preconceptions.\n\n\n\nPublic Perception: Katherine is respected as a dedicated and principled educator, though some find her overly idealistic and occasionally rigid in her views. Her clashes with the Metalhead community and her attempts to silence pirate broadcasts have created a divide between her and the younger, more rebellious students. Despite this, she is seen as a champion of journalistic integrity, someone who holds herself and her students to high ethical standards, even if that means stepping on a few toes in the process.\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Randolph-Tomaszewski":{"title":"Randolph Tomaszewski","links":["caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom","caroline-college/NPCs/Leonid-Kuznetsov"],"tags":[],"content":"Randolph Tomaszewski\n\nRole/Title:\n\nMember of Church of the Delayed Blossom\n\nBrief Description:\nRandolph is a tall, gaunt young man in his early twenties with a mop of dark hair and haunted eyes.

Despite facing hardships growing up, he managed to excel academically and was on track to become a doctor before falling under the influence of the Church of the Delayed Blossom.\nPersonality: Randolph is introverted, often appearing withdrawn or disoriented due to his medication. He can be charming when he wants to be but also has a tendency towards volatility and aggression, especially when stressed or provoked.

Jan Ducochik: Randolph has had some limited interactions with Sgt. Ducochik, who has shown him kindness and concern despite not knowing about his involvement in the cult. This interaction has left a positive impression on Randolph, making him more likely to trust or confide in the police officer.\nRonnie &#039;Moonglow&#039; Regan: Ronnie&#039;s curiosity and enthusiasm for the occult have caught Randolph&#039;s attention. He sees her as a potential ally but also worries that her youth and thirst for the truth may turn her into a liability.\nLeonid &quot;Lenny&quot; Kuznetsov: Randolph met Leonid Kuznetsov while Randolph was stealing food and supplies from the store, Dominick&#039;s, where Lenny works.

This fear drives much of his behavior and motivates him to find a way to break free from their influence.\nFear of Failure: Randolph fears that he will not be able to complete his plans against the cult or find a way to reverse his transformation into a ghast. This fear often manifests as self-doubt or indecision.\n\nGoals:\n\nFreedom from the Church of the Delayed Blossom: Randolph&#039;s ultimate goal is to sever his connection with the cult and gain control over his own life once again.\nUncovering the Truth: He wants to discover what caused his transformation into a ghast and find a way to reverse or manage it, ultimately using this knowledge to strike back against those who have harmed him.\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Regional-Metal-Bands":{"title":"Regional Metal Bands","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Regional Bands Featured on Metal at Midnight:\n\n\nGrave Tide\n\nSongs: &quot;Black Sands&quot; / &quot;Phantom Dream&quot;\nThemes: &quot;Black Sands&quot; deals with a cursed desert that draws people in, never to return. &quot;Phantom Dream&quot; explores the idea of living in a perpetual nightmare, unable to distinguish reality from dreams.\nSong Descriptions:\n\n&quot;Black Sands&quot; (Fast, heavy riffs with eerie, sustained guitar notes.

Her eyes are a striking green, and she wears round glasses that slide down her nose whenever she looks thoughtful or curious. She has an infectious enthusiasm for the occult and often dresses in thrift store finds inspired by her parents&#039; hippie past. Despite her love for all things mysterious, there&#039;s an innocence about Ronnie that makes it hard to imagine her as anything but a small-town teenager. She is fond of the old librarian Sly Coolstein and tries to help him as often as she can.\nBiography:\n\nBackground: Ronnie was raised by her free-spirited parents, who moved back to Watashuka after living in various communes and counterculture hubs around the country. She grew up surrounded by stories of their adventures and became captivated by the idea of hidden knowledge and secret histories. Her love for books and the occult led her to volunteer at the Peach St. Library, where she now works as an assistant.\nPersonality: Ronnie is curious, imaginative, and always eager to learn more about the world around her. She&#039;s a bit clumsy and often loses track of time when engrossed in a book or conversation. Her enthusiasm can sometimes border on naivety, but she has a good heart and genuinely cares for others.\nMotivations: Ronnie&#039;s primary goal is to uncover hidden truths about the world and its history, especially those connected to the occult. She hopes that her experiences at the library will lead her to discover something extraordinary. Additionally, she wants to protect Watashuka from any threats lurking in its shadows.\nSecrets: Ronnie has started to notice strange occurrences around town but hasn&#039;t yet put all the pieces together. Unbeknownst to her, some of the cult members have taken an interest in her curiosity and are considering whether they should recruit or eliminate her.\n\nHobbies:\n\nDrawing and Painting: Ronnie enjoys expressing her creativity through art, often incorporating occult symbols and creatures from mythology into her work.\nInvestigative Journalism (in spirit): Alongside her friends, Ronnie conducts informal investigations into local legends and rumors, hoping to uncover hidden truths about Watashuka&#039;s past.\n\nFears:\n\nFear of Ridicule: Ronnie fears being laughed at or ridiculed for her beliefs, especially regarding politics. Due to her parents&#039; hippie background, she has faced teasing because of her name and their shared dislike for President Ronald Reagan.\nClaustrophobia: Ronnie harbors a deep-seated fear of being trapped or confined, stemming from a childhood incident involving an old root cellar.\n\nGoals:\n\nPublishing Her Discoveries: One of Ronnie&#039;s long-term goals is to write and publish a book about her experiences and discoveries in Watashuka, hoping that it will inspire others to explore the mysteries hidden within their own towns.\nProtecting Watashuka: Ronnie wants to use her growing knowledge of local lore and legends to safeguard her hometown from any supernatural threats or cult activity.\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Sgt.-Jan-Ducochik":{"title":"Sgt. Jan Ducochik","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/NPCs/Captain-Bernard-Miller","caroline-college/NPCs/Norm-Habersham"],"tags":[],"content":"\nSergeant Jan Ducochik (Devout Investigator of the Supernatural, Outwardly Polite but Secretly Condescending)\n\n\nRole: Sergeant Jan Ducochik is a first-generation American and devout Catholic serving in the Watashuka Police Department. Since joining the force in 1980, Jan has become increasingly aware of strange and unsettling occurrences in the town. Over the last three years, he has quietly begun investigating these supernatural events, convinced that something dark is happening beneath Watashuka&#039;s peaceful exterior. He is highly suspicious of his colleagues, believing many of them to be involved in occult activities. Ducochik feels isolated in his pursuit of the truth, fearing that those in power—including his captain—might be working against him.\n\n\nAge: Early 30s (1983)\n\n\nAppearance: Jan is a sharp, well-groomed man with striking blue eyes, a chiseled face, and a thick mustache that gives him a serious, authoritative air. His dark blonde hair is neatly combed, and his police uniform is always pressed and immaculate, reflecting his disciplined nature. Jan’s appearance embodies the image of a dedicated law enforcement officer—professional, vigilant, and capable. His intense gaze often betrays the weight of the unseen burden he carries, constantly on alert for signs of the supernatural.\n\n\nPersonality: Jan is a man of quiet conviction and deep faith. His strong Catholic upbringing instilled in him a strict moral code, which makes it difficult for him to ignore the growing strangeness around Watashuka. His serious demeanor and sharp investigative mind make him well-suited for the police force, but his intense focus on the supernatural has made him increasingly paranoid about those around him. Jan is particularly wary of his colleagues, many of whom he suspects of being involved in occult practices. He has a strong sense of justice and views himself as the town’s last line of defense against the unknown forces at play, though his investigations are often lonely and dangerous.\n\n\nReligious Conviction: While Jan is outwardly respectful of the town’s Lutheran traditions, he internally feels that his Catholic faith is superior. He harbors condescending thoughts toward the town’s religious practices, viewing the Lutheran church as lacking in both depth and spiritual strength. Despite this, Jan keeps his thoughts carefully hidden, projecting a polite and cooperative front. He attends town events and services when necessary, but with a subtle sense of superiority, engaging only as much as is required. His true feelings, however, tend to slip through in moments of stress or when he believes the town is in immediate danger. He avoids direct confrontation about religion, preferring to maintain his position while holding on to his secret judgments.\n\n\nPublic Role:\n\nPolice Force: Jan is a dedicated sergeant who is well-liked by the community for his professionalism and sense of duty. However, within the police force, he is viewed as something of an outsider. His quiet, suspicious nature has led to some tension with his colleagues, especially as he begins to uncover evidence of corruption and occult influence within the department. While Jan’s superiors, including Captain Bernard Miller, often dismiss his concerns as overreactions, his persistence has made him a thorn in their side.\nInvestigator of the Unexplained: Over the past three years, Jan has taken it upon himself to investigate the bizarre events that the rest of the department seems to ignore. He has compiled a secret file of unusual occurrences—disappearances, strange symbols, mysterious deaths—and works covertly with Norm Habersham, the town’s newspaper editor, to uncover the truth. Jan often feels like he is the only one who truly sees what is happening in Watashuka.\n\n\n\nSuspicion of Captain Bernard Miller: Jan is particularly suspicious of Captain Bernard Miller, his superior officer. He believes Miller’s frequent trips out of town, combined with his reluctance to investigate the town’s strange occurrences, are evidence that the captain is involved with the cults or other dark forces manipulating Watashuka. Jan has been quietly gathering evidence against Miller, though he misinterprets the captain’s secret trips to Milwaukee as something sinister when, in reality, they are a cover for Miller’s secret gay lifestyle. This misreading of Miller’s behavior fuels Jan’s growing paranoia and puts him at odds with the captain, who is often pressured by town leadership to suppress Jan’s investigations.\n\n\nKey Relationships:\n\nNorm Habersham (Local Newspaper Editor): Norm and Jan have struck up a quiet partnership, with Norm often feeding Jan tips about unusual happenings around town. Norm&#039;s knowledge of the town’s history and Jan&#039;s investigative skills complement each other, and together they’ve uncovered several disturbing pieces of evidence pointing to cult activity and corruption. Despite this, they are both wary of how far they can push before attracting the wrong kind of attention.\nCaptain Bernard Miller: Jan’s mistrust of Miller grows stronger by the day. He believes Miller’s frequent absences and nonchalance about the strange occurrences in Watashuka are signs that the captain is involved in the town’s occult activity. Jan spends much of his free time secretly trying to track the captain’s movements and find proof of his complicity, though he has yet to uncover the true nature of Miller’s secret life.\n\n\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nUncovering Cult Influence: Jan could be an ally to investigators looking into the occult forces in Watashuka. He already has several pieces of evidence that point to something larger at work and may be willing to share his findings with those he trusts. However, his paranoia and mistrust of others could make him difficult to approach without the proper credentials or a show of faith.\nCaptain Miller Investigation: Jan&#039;s suspicion of Captain Bernard Miller could be a double-edged sword for investigators. While Jan may offer help in uncovering what he believes to be Miller&#039;s sinister connections, the truth of Miller’s secret is much more personal than supernatural. Investigators could either try to dissuade Jan from pursuing the captain or use the tension between the two men to their advantage.\nPersonal Investigation: Players could gain Jan&#039;s trust by assisting him in his investigations. As one of the few non-cult members within the police force, Jan is a valuable resource. His suspicions about his colleagues might lead players to dangerous truths hidden within the department.\n\n\n\nPublic Perception: Jan is seen as a reliable and diligent police officer by most of Watashuka&#039;s residents, though his colleagues within the force often view him as overly suspicious or even paranoid. He is respected for his work ethic but is also seen as something of an outsider due to his quiet, intensely focused nature. His investigations into the strange happenings around town have gained him a reputation as someone who asks too many questions, and some believe he might be looking for trouble where none exists.\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath":{"title":"Shub-Niggurath","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"caroline-college/NPCs/Sly-Coolstein":{"title":"Sly Coolstein","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Watashuka","caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled","caroline-college/NPCs/Ronnie-Regan","caroline-college/NPCs/Leonid-Kuznetsov"],"tags":[],"content":"Sly Coolstein (Head Librarian, Cultist, and Protector)\n\n\n\nRole: Sly Coolstein is the head (and only full-time) librarian at the Peach Street Library, Watashuka’s only public library. An older, bookish man, Sly is deeply committed to the academic world, fascinated by texts both ancient and modern. His life revolves around the library, and he can often be found pouring over obscure reference books and historical documents. Despite being a member in good standing with Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, Sly seems harmless at first glance. He’s often teased by children who frequent the library, but he rarely seems bothered by it, retreating into his books to avoid confrontation. Despite his allegiance to the Brotherhood, he protects his assistant, Ronnie Regan..\n\n\nAge: Early 60s (1983)\n\n\nAppearance: Sly has the stereotypical appearance of a scholarly recluse. He is thin and pale, with thinning gray hair and large, round glasses that seem perpetually perched on the end of his nose. He typically wears outdated suits or sweater vests, often a bit frayed at the edges, giving him the appearance of someone who cares little for personal presentation. His hands are almost always stained with ink, and he carries the smell of old books with him wherever he goes. Sly’s appearance is largely forgettable, which suits him fine, as it allows him to blend into the background of the town’s happenings while he quietly pursues his own interests.\n\n\nPersonality: Sly is the epitome of the absent-minded academic—intensely knowledgeable but completely inept at handling real-world situations. He has a passion for arcane knowledge and historical texts, and his mind is often so preoccupied with esoteric subjects that he struggles to make basic connections in everyday life. Despite being involved in the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, he approaches the cult with the same academic detachment as he does any other subject, focusing more on the knowledge and rituals rather than the consequences of their actions. Sly is not malicious by nature, but his involvement in the cult stems from a desire to learn, not from a desire to wield power. This detachment makes him somewhat of an enigma—dangerous in his ignorance but not inherently malevolent.\n\n\nPublic Role:\n\nPeach Street Library: Sly has been the head of the Peach Street Library for decades, and most of the town sees him as little more than a quirky, eccentric figure who lives among the books. The library itself is a small, underfunded institution, and Sly spends much of his time organizing books, cataloging old documents, and occasionally helping the few patrons who visit. He takes pride in the library&#039;s collection, especially the older, rarer texts, some of which are connected to the occult—though he never advertises that fact.\nTeasing by Children: Sly’s name, Sly Coolstein, has long been a source of amusement for the town’s children, who come up with a variety of nicknames to tease him. Common taunts include:\n\n“Sly Foolstein”\n“The Cool Nerd”\n“Sneaky Sly”:\n“Dewey Decimal Dingus”\n&quot;NOT Coolstein&quot;\n\n\nSly is largely unfazed by these teases, though there is a part of him that longs for more respect. He typically responds by muttering under his breath or feigning indifference, but the constant teasing has made him even more reclusive.\n\n\n\nRelationship with Ronnie Regan: Despite being deeply entrenched in the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, Sly has a soft spot for his assistant. Though Ronnie is very interested in the occult, Sly has worked hard to make sure she does not suspect him. In return, he has protected her many times over the years. Most recently from a stalking attempt by Leonid Kuznetsov.  Sly sees her as a rare source of innocence and purity—qualities that are increasingly hard to find in Watashuka. Sly protects Ronnie out of a paternal instinct, seeing her as someone who needs to be shielded from the darker forces at work in the town and works hard to keep her away from the Brotherhood’s activities.\n\nRonnie’s Loyalty: Ronnie often helps Sly with various tasks at the library, from shelving books to assisting with the cataloging of ancient texts. She has no idea of Sly’s involvement with the Brotherhood or the dangerous knowledge hidden within the library’s more obscure collections. Sly goes out of his way to keep Ronnie from discovering the darker secrets of his life. When she seeks out new occult information, Sly carefully curates what information she has access to.\n\n\n\nCult Involvement:\n\nBrotherhood of the Gate Unveiled: Sly is a member of the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled, a cult dedicated to using eldritch knowledge and rituals to access forbidden powers. While other cult members are motivated by ambition or a thirst for power, Sly is primarily driven by academic curiosity. To him, the rituals and texts are simply extensions of his study, things to be cataloged and analyzed rather than feared. This detachment makes him dangerous, as he often fails to grasp the full consequences of the dark forces he’s aligning himself with.\nKnowledge-Seeker, Not a Leader: Sly’s position in the Brotherhood is that of a scholar rather than a leader. He is valued for his deep knowledge of ancient texts and his access to the library’s rare collections, but he has little interest in wielding power or influence. His primary concern is the preservation and understanding of knowledge, even if that knowledge is forbidden or dangerous. Sly’s fellow cultists view him as useful but somewhat out of touch with the true goals of the Brotherhood.\n\n\n\nPotential Hooks for Investigators:\n\nAccess to Forbidden Knowledge: Sly’s vast knowledge of ancient texts and occult rituals could make him a valuable ally for investigators—if they can get past his absent-minded demeanor and recognize the depth of his involvement in the Brotherhood. Sly’s library contains rare texts that might hold the key to understanding the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka, though gaining his trust will be a challenge.\nProtecting Ronnie: If investigators discover Sly’s protective relationship with Ronnie, they may use it as leverage to convince him to share what he knows. Sly’s desire to keep Ronnie safe could be a point of vulnerability, one that investigators might exploit to get him to cooperate.\nUnintentional Villainy: Sly’s academic curiosity and inability to connect the dots make him a dangerous figure, even if he is not overtly malevolent. His involvement with the Brotherhood might lead him to unwittingly release dark forces or initiate rituals that threaten the town. Investigators might need to decide whether to stop Sly outright or try to guide him away from the more dangerous aspects of his research.\n\n\n\nPublic Perception: To most of Watashuka’s residents, Sly is a harmless oddball—a reclusive librarian who spends more time with books than with people. The town’s children enjoy teasing him, seeing him as an easy target, but adults generally view him as harmless and eccentric. His connection to the Brotherhood is known only to a select few, and most of the town has no idea that the unassuming librarian is involved in something far more sinister.\n\n"},"caroline-college/NPCs/WCTU":{"title":"WCTU","links":["caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College"],"tags":[],"content":"Caroline College&#039;s public radio station."},"caroline-college/NPCs/Yog-Sothoth":{"title":"Yog-Sothoth","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"caroline-college/Player-Guide/Character-Creation":{"title":"Character Creation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Character creation will happen during session zero.\nThe general method for character creation is found in the 7th ed.  of the Call of Cthulhu Keeper&#039;s Guide.

Some themes may be disturbing to some players. Players are required to engage with the Session Zero to ensure that the game is appropriate for themselves, all players, and the keeper at the table.\n\nCharacter Creation\nDetermining Character Stats\nCap on Starting Skill Values\n\nNo starting skill can be above 60% after modifications.\n\nRolling and Distributing Characteristics\nFor Caroline College, we use a variant of Option 3: Choosing Where to Place Rolled Characteristics.\n\nRoll 6 × 3d6 and distribute the results across:\n\nStrength (STR)\nConstitution (CON)\nDexterity (DEX)\nAppearance (APP)\nPower (POW)\nLuck (LUCK)\n\n\nRoll 3 × (2d6+6) and distribute the results across:\n\nSize (SIZ)\nIntelligence (INT)\nEducation (EDU)\nNote on Skill Caps: To reflect the inexperience of college freshmen, the cap on starting skills is set at 60%. This ensures characters have room for noticeable growth throughout the campaign.\n\n\n\nOccupation: College Student\nAll characters at Caroline College use the occupation College Student.\n\nOccupation Skill Points: EDU × 3 (Reduced from the standard to reflect starting students but with more opportunities for advancement during the campaign).\nCredit Rating: 5–10\nSuggested Contacts: Other students.\nSkills:\n\nLanguage (Own or Other)\nLibrary Use\nListen\nThree Fields of Study (choose three academic skills relevant to your character&#039;s studies)\nAny Two Other Skills as personal or era specialties\n\n\n\nBackstory Elements\nDeveloping a rich backstory adds depth to your character and enhances the gaming experience. Each character should create entries for the following areas, aiming for meaningful and engaging content. This is a horror game, so dark elements within a backstory is acceptable, thematically appropriate, and strongly encouraged (within the limits defined by Session Zero). Try to remember that your characters don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening in the setting yet; hints and suggestions go a long way!\nIdeology/Beliefs\n\nBad Example: &quot;I believe in justice.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s bad: Too vague and generic; lacks depth.\n\n\nAcceptable Example: &quot;I believe that the legal system is flawed, and true justice can only be achieved outside of it.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s acceptable: Adds complexity and hints at potential conflicts.\n\n\nGood Example: &quot;Ethan prowls the city&#039;s backstreets at night, where justice rarely reaches. When the courts failed him and the guilty walked free, he wasn&#039;t above bending the rules to set things right. To him, the law is just a guideline, and true justice sometimes requires a darker path that others might deem questionable.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s good: Provides depth, aligns with game themes, and introduces moral ambiguity.\n\n\n\nSignificant People\n\nBad Example: &quot;My mother.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s bad: Too general; doesn&#039;t explain significance.\n\n\nAcceptable Example: &quot;My mother, who supported my academic pursuits.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s acceptable: Offers context but lacks depth.\n\n\nGood Example: &quot;Amelia carries a tattered letter from her estranged mother, filled with unsent words of apology. She reads it under dim lamplight, wondering about the life her mother chose over her family. Each word fuels Amelia&#039;s resolve to find her, not just to reconnect, but to understand the choices that led them apart.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s good: Adds personal stakes, urgency, and ties to potential plot lines.\n\n\n\nMeaningful Locations\n\nBad Example: &quot;The park.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s bad: Too vague; lacks meaningful context.\n\n\nAcceptable Example: &quot;The old park near my childhood home where I used to play.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s acceptable: Provides some context but lacks depth.\n\n\nGood Example: &quot;The rusted remains of the old Ferris wheel loom over the deserted fairground, a place where Lucas once shared a fleeting moment of joy with his first love before she moved away without a word. He returns there, the silence heavy with memories and unanswered questions, hoping one day to recapture that lost connection or at least find closure.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s good: Rich atmosphere, ties into supernatural elements, and profoundly impacts the character.\n\n\n\nTreasured Possessions\n\nBad Example: &quot;A book.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s bad: Generic; doesn&#039;t reveal anything about the character.\n\n\nAcceptable Example: &quot;An old diary from my grandmother.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s acceptable: Provides a familial connection but could be more detailed.\n\n\nGood Example: &quot;Lily discovered an old, leather-bound book hidden behind a loose brick in her grandmother&#039;s fireplace. The pages are filled with faded handwriting and strange symbols she doesn&#039;t understand. As she reads, unsettling family secrets begin to surface—stories of forgotten ancestors and choices that cast long shadows over her family&#039;s history, secrets they had tried desperately to keep buried. At least she knows she isn&#039;t alone in her bad choices.&quot;\n\nWhy it&#039;s good: Deeply personal, tied to game lore, and serves as a catalyst for adventures.\n\n\n\n\nBalancing Classes and Investigations\nClass Selection\nPlayers must balance academic responsibilities with their mystery-solving adventures.\n\nEach Semester, players must choose 5 classes.\n\nFreshman Fall Semester:\n\n3 Required Classes:\n\nOne Science\nOne History\nOne Language\n\n\n2 Optional Classes:\n\nChosen from the list of electives.\n\n\n\nPassing a Class\nTo pass a class, players must:\n\nPass the Final Exam:\n- Involves making an advancement roll in the relevant topic.\n\nLuck may be used on this roll.\n\n\nOptionally, Meet the Attendance Requirement:\n- Attend at least 70% of the class sessions (determined narratively).\n\nMeeting attendance grants a +5% bonus to the relevant skill (in addition to advancements from exams).\n\n\n\nExams\n\nMid-Term and Final Exams will be held each semester.\nPassing the Mid-Term:\n\nGrants a Penalty Die on the final exam advancement roll.\nNote: In advancement rolls, a failed roll results in skill improvement. Therefore, the Penalty Die increases your chance to fail the roll, which benefits your skill advancement.\n\n\nFailing a Class:\n\nIf you fail the final exam but met the attendance requirement, you still gain the +5% bonus.\n\n\n\nTension Mechanic\nPlayers must choose between attending classes or pursuing adventures, balancing academic success with their investigations.\n\nSkipping Classes may lead to:\n\nFalling grades.\nLoss of skill advancement opportunities.\nPotential narrative consequences.\n\n\nBenefits of Academic Success:\n\nAt the keeper&#039;s discretion, and at thematically appropriate times, academic achievements may grant benefits.\nExample: Passing all exams in a semester might unlock access to exclusive resources, faculty support, or special permissions.\n\n\n\n\nMechanics Adjustments\nSanity Loss Adjustments\n\nReading Mythos Tomes:\n\nCosts sanity but will not trigger bouts of madness or insanity if done in a safe environment.\n\n\n\nRecovery from Indefinite Insanity\nStudents at Caroline College have access to counseling sessions provided by the local Lutheran church. These sessions are non-religious and aim to aid students in recovering from indefinite insanity and trauma.\n\nWeekly Counseling Sessions:\n\nAvailability: Once per week when not participating in a game session.\nSanity Recovery Mechanics:\n\nRecovery Attempt:\n\nRoll percentile dice (1d100).\nOn a result of 01–95:\n\nSuccess: Recover 1d10 Sanity Points.\n\n\nOn a result of 96–100:\n\nSetback:\n\nLose 1d6 Sanity Points.\nGain a new phobia related to the stress or topics discussed during counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolving Indefinite Insanity:\n\nIf Sanity Points are gained during a counseling session, you may immediately make a Sanity check (using your updated Sanity score).\nOn a Hard Success, your indefinite insanity is resolved.\n\n\n\n\nTime Commitment:\n\nAttending a counseling session requires an in-game time slot, potentially conflicting with classes or investigations.\n\n\nKeeper&#039;s Note:\n\nFrequent therapy sessions may draw attention or have narrative implications, adding to the tension of balancing time.\nFailed Therapy Sessions:\n\nMay induce phobias related to the therapy content, providing additional story hooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuck Recovery and Advancement\nLuck advancements are made at the start of every game session.\n\nLuck Recovery Mechanics:\n\nImprovement Check:\n\nRoll 1d100.\nIf the roll is above your current Luck, add 1d10 points.\nIf the roll is equal to or less than your current Luck, no points are recovered.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nLuck may not exceed 99.\nThe starting Luck value is not used again in the game.\n\n\n\nSkill Advancements\nSkill advancements are made after thematically appropriate breaks, as determined by the keeper (expect 3–5 per semester, including exams).\nPvP Interactions and Loss of Control\n\nPlayer vs. Player (PvP) &#039;Attacks&#039;:\n\nMust be made with consent of all involved players.\n\n\nLoss of Control Situations:\n\nOccur when a character is under the effects of insanity, a Breakdown due to Distress, or certain supernatural influences.\nActions are at the keeper&#039;s discretion.\nThe keeper should consider player enjoyment and strive for consensual storytelling.\n\n\n\nBackstory Connections\n\nRobust and Thematically Appropriate Backstories:\n\nInclude one or more entries with a dark element.\nDevelop meaningful locations, significant people, and pivotal events that add depth.\n\n\nCharacter Connections:\n\nEvery character must have a connection to at least two other characters in the party in their backstory.\nNo character can have more than two connections to them.\n\n\n\nGroup Skill Checks\n\nAssisting with Skill Rolls:\n\nIf more than one character attempts a skill roll for the same task, under pressure:\n\nIf at least two characters have skill above baseline, one person can make the roll with a Bonus Die.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending Luck\n\nLuck Points can be spent to alter the result of a skill or characteristic roll on a 1-for-1 basis.\nRestrictions:\n\nCannot spend Luck on:\n\nLuck rolls\nDamage rolls\nSanity rolls\nRolls to determine the amount of Sanity points lost\n\n\nCannot spend Luck on Pushed Rolls.\nCriticals, Fumbles, and Firearm Malfunctions cannot be altered with Luck.\nNo skill improvement check is earned if Luck was used to alter the roll.\n\n\n\n\nExpanded Sanity Rules\nThese OPTIONAL rules add psychological realism to the Sanity mechanics, fitting for modern or historical settings where characters may be hardy and accustomed to man-made horrors.

They are designed to enhance the horror experience in long-term campaigns without incapacitating characters through excessive Sanity loss.\nThese rules were heavily inspired by the work Apostol Apostolov at  Chaosium Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition House Rules\nIntroduction\nThe Expanded Sanity Rules introduce a new mechanic called Distress Points (DSP) to add psychological depth and realism to our game. Like standard Sanity Points (SAN), which decrease as characters encounter supernatural horrors, Distress Points start at a maximum value and decrease as characters face stress from realistic, non-supernatural threats. This allows characters to handle man-made horrors and stressful situations without immediate risk of madness.\nDistress Points (DSP)\nWhat Are Distress Points?\n\nDistress Points represent your character&#039;s mental resilience to stress from non-supernatural situations, such as tough decisions, resource scarcity, or dangerous environments.\nEvery character starts with DSP equal to their POW (similar to how SAN is calculated).\n\nLosing Distress Points\n\nNon-Supernatural Encounters: Non-supernatural horrors cause DSP loss instead of SAN loss. This would replace the traditional sanity roll for these mundane encounters.\nStressful Situations: When facing non-horrific, but still stress situations, DSP checks may need to be made.\nSAN Rolls: Making a sanity roll, by definition, is caused by a situation that is stressful. You lose a a DSP every time a sanity roll is made; pass or fail.\nVoluntary SAN Damage: You can always choose to take SAN damage instead of losing DSP, but not the reverse.\n\nEffects of Distress Points\n\nAbove Half DSP (more than half of your maximum DSP): You remain composed; your hidden traits are under control.\nEqual to or Below Half DSP (half or less of your maximum DSP):\n\nBegin to show minor signs of stress linked to your Dark Trait.\nEach time you lose 5 or more DSP at once, roll against your current DSP. If you roll equal to or less than your DSP, you experience a Breakdown for 1d4 rounds.\n\n\nEqual to or Below One-Fifth DSP (one-fifth or less of your maximum DSP):\n\nYour behavior is noticeably affected by your Dark Trait.\nBreakdowns last longer (1d10 rounds), and the Keeper may suggest actions for your character.\n\n\nAt Zero DSP:\n\nYou suffer a Complete Breakdown.\nThe Keeper may take control of your character until DSP is recovered.\n\n\n\nMaximum DSP\n\nDSP cannot exceed your starting value (POW). Rest and recovery can help you regain lost DSP up to this maximum.\n\nExample of a Breakdown\nScenario:\nMaria, an investigator with a starting POW of 60, starts with DSP = 60. Her Dark Trait is Paranoia, which she keeps hidden from the rest of the team.\nEvents Leading to the Breakdown:\n\nInitial Stress:\n\nMaria and her team are exploring an abandoned asylum.\nShe encounters realistic but disturbing graffiti and unsettling noises.\nOver time, she loses 20 DSP, reducing her DSP to 40.\n\n\nDSP at Half Maximum:\n\nSince her DSP is now at 40 (which is two-thirds of 60), she remains composed.\n\n\nFurther Stress:\n\nThe team finds a room with detailed accounts of past tortures (non-supernatural).\nMaria loses 15 DSP due to the distressing content, bringing her DSP down to 25.\n\n\nDSP Falls to Half or Less:\n\nWith DSP at 25 (less than half of 60), she begins to show minor signs of her Dark Trait (Paranoia).\nShe starts questioning the intentions of her teammates subtly.\n\n\nTriggering a Breakdown:\n\nSuddenly, a realistic but horrific trap is sprung, causing Maria to lose 10 DSP at once, dropping her DSP to 15.\nBecause she lost 5 or more DSP at once and her DSP is below half, she must roll against her current DSP (15).\n\nShe rolls a 22, which is above her DSP.\nBreakdown Triggered: The Breakdown will last 1d4 rounds (let&#039;s say she rolls a 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Breakdown:\n\nBehavior:\n\nFor the next 3 rounds, Maria&#039;s paranoia takes over.\nShe becomes convinced that one of her teammates is sabotaging the mission.\nShe might accuse them openly, refuse to share information, or even act defensively if approached.\n\n\nKeeper&#039;s Role:\n\nThe Keeper reminds Maria&#039;s player of her Dark Trait and suggests actions that reflect her heightened paranoia.\nThe player can choose how to role-play these suggestions within the confines of the Breakdown.\n\n\n\nAfter the Breakdown:\n\nMaria&#039;s DSP remains at 15.\nShe regains some composure but still shows signs of stress.\nThe team may notice her odd behavior, and she might need to find ways to recover DSP.\n\nDark Traits\nWhat Are Dark Traits?\n\nDark Traits are hidden aspects of your character&#039;s personality that emerge under stress.\nThey add depth to your character and provide role-playing opportunities.\n\nSelecting a Dark Trait\n\nChoose a Dark Trait during character creation. It should remain secret from other players but not the keeper.\nExamples include traits like paranoia, obsession, aggression, or compulsiveness.\nYour Dark Trait influences how your character behaves as DSP decreases.\n\nRevealing Dark Traits\n\nAs DSP decreases, subtle behaviors linked to your Dark Trait begin to surface.\nUnder severe stress or during Breakdowns, these traits may dominate your actions.\n\nManaging Distress\n\nRest and Relaxation:\n\nShort Rest: Resting for at least an hour in a safe, comfortable environment restores 1d10 DSP. This cannot be repeated until at least one point of DSP has been lost.\nExtended Rest: A full day of rest restores 10 DSP (may be repeated as needed).\n\n\nComposure Attempts:\n\nPOW Roll: Attempt a POW roll to compose yourself. If your current DSP is at or below half maximum, the roll is of Hard difficulty.\nSuccess: Restores 1d4 DSP during danger or 1d6+1 DSP when safe.\n\n\nAssistance from Allies:\n\nAnother character can use a Psychology roll to help you recover.\nSuccess has the same effects as a successful POW roll. These cannot be used in conjugation. But if one fails, the other may be attempted.\n\n\nIndulging in Manias:\n\nEngaging in a personal mania restores 1d6+1 DSP.\nRequires a Sanity roll; failure results in 1 SAN loss.\n\n\n\nPacing Stress Loss\n\nTo keep gameplay smooth, DSP losses can be accumulated over a scene and applied at the end.\nThis minimizes interruptions and maintains narrative flow.\nImmediate DSP losses may still occur during sudden shocks or critical moments.\n\nIncreased Impact of Phobias\n\nIf your character has a Phobia, encountering its trigger doubles any DSP losses.\n\nPurpose of These Rules\n\nEnhanced Role-Playing: Allows for deeper character development as hidden traits surface under stress.\nBalanced Horror Experience: Maintains the horror atmosphere without quickly incapacitating characters through massive Sanity loss.\nLong-Term Campaign Suitability: Ideal for extended play, where character arcs and psychological journeys are explored over time.\n\nConclusion\nPlease consider how these rules might enhance your gaming experience.

The Ho-Chunk people, who have inhabited the area for centuries, are aware of the ley lines’ power and use their knowledge to protect the land from dark forces. The ley lines are believed to be spiritual conduits, connecting this world to ancient, unknowable cosmic forces.\n\nMay 1856 – Prairieville Academy Founded by Occultists\n\nPrairieville Academy is established by a group of occultists led by Walter Mann, Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling. They recruited three locals, with a less than pristine past, to clear the lands of the local tribes and abduct the first &#039;students&#039;. The academy’s true purpose is to gather young students, particularly Native American youths, to perform dark rituals on in order to summon what Mann described as the &#039;original god&#039;. Unknown to him, the god he dreamt of is the eldritch god, Cthulhu.\nThe idea for the school came to Mann in a dream. Root and Sterling were his first, and most loyal, recruits.\nThe Academy is built at a key ley line nexus, chosen specifically for its supernatural energy.\nTheir rituals target young Native American students, attempting to use their connection to the land and its power to fuel a major summoning.\nUnknown to each other, each founder is being influenced by a different eldritch entity but they think they are on the path to summoning the same &quot;original god.&quot; They don’t realize they are being manipulated by Nyarlathotep.\nFounding Members\n- Walter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy\n- Eleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated\n- John W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated\n- Elias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen\n- Jonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian\n- Sarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist\n\nAugust 1860 – Destruction of Prairieville Academy (Ritual Interrupted)\n\nThe Ho-Chunk people, aware of the academy’s dark purpose, attack to stop a major ritual. This ritual involved the transformation of several Ho-Chunk youths for a summoning of the &#039;original god&#039;.\nThe Ho-Chunk succeed in halting the ritual and destroyed the academy in the process. Many die, including Mann and most of the original cult members. However, both Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling survive.\nThe destruction of the Academy opens the way for the arrival of the Amish, who recognize the ley lines and the region&#039;s supernatural danger. They quietly establish themselves to act as protectors of the land.\n\nSeptember 1862 – Prairieville School opened\n\nEleazar Root and John W. Sterling, the surviving occultists, believe that the failed ritual must have been due to sabotage due to a deviation from the &#039;true path&#039;.\n\nRoot, following Shub-Niggurath forms Church of the Delayed Blossom. This cult focuses on manipulating nature and fertility.\nSterling, following Yog-Sothoth, forms Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled. This cult focuses on time manipulation and dimensional gates.\n\n\nBoth believe they are following the true way to summon the &quot;original god&quot; and view each other as being misled.\nThe two cults have an uneasy relationship. Sometime waring against one another and sometimes cooperating; hoping to bring the other back to the &#039;true path&#039;.\nBoth cults compete to control key ley line nodes, conducting rituals at specific locations across the town, especially within Caroline College and its precursor institutions.\nBoth cults reestablish themselves in secret under the guise of the rebuilt Prairieville School. They slowly gather power and influence over the next several decades, controlling different aspects of the school and infiltrating local society.\n\nJanuary 1888 - The Blizzard of 1888\n\nThe Blizzard of 1888 sparked a turning point for the region. The failed ritual paved the way for a new faction, the Lutheran Church to enter the area.\n\n**April 1895 – Creation of Caroline Religious Teaching College\n\nThe cults gain power through unsuspecting Lutheran immigrants, who push for the school’s expansion into Caroline Religious Teaching College. The immigrants believe they are establishing a religious institution, unaware that the cults are using their influence to mask their occult activities. Many devout Lutherans are tricked into taking part of the cults rituals. The Lutherans believe they have received divine messages from their God when in reality it is cult magic and deception.\nThe town is renamed Watashuka, a mistranslation of the Ho-Chunk word Waceǧi, meaning &quot;dangerous,&quot; reflecting the native people&#039;s warning about the area.\n\n1930s-1940s – Cult Influence Spreads and Project Caroline Begins\n\nAs WWII approaches, the cults’ activities intensify. The U.S. government, becoming aware of strange phenomena tied to the college and town, starts a secret research initiative called Project Caroline.\nProject Caroline is aimed at studying the supernatural phenomena in the region, initially under the guise of wartime research. However, its true focus is on harnessing eldritch power for potential military or espionage purposes.\nThe Ostensibly wartime research, its true focus is on studying and controlling the supernatural power of the ley lines for military purposes and later towards winning the space race.\n\nCult Manipulation: During this time, the cults increase their influence over the college, using the chaos of the war to mask their own experiments and rituals. The Lutherans are nearly compromised by cult members who infiltrate their ranks, but the end of the war and the expansion of Project Caroline provide a temporary reprieve.\nRitual Failure: Another major cult ritual fails during this period, The Baptism of &#039;39, leading to another name change for the college. The post-war push for scientific expansion transforms the college into a modern liberal arts institution, Caroline College, though the cults remain entrenched. Its failure is what led to the government&#039;s involvement in the region.\n\n\n\n1969 – Project Caroline &quot;Ends,&quot; but Cults Step Up Activity\n\nEvent: Under the Nixon administration, Project Caroline is publicly terminated due to concerns over government overreach and having &#039;won&#039; the space race. However, it is implied that Nixon himself was influenced by the cult of Yog-Sothoth, seeking to end the government&#039;s interference and allow the cults to continue their work without oversight.\n\nCults Take Advantage: During this period, the cults believe they are finally free from government interference and ramp up their activities.\nSecret Continuation: After Nixon&#039;s removal from office, elements within the government begin quietly restarting Project Caroline, aiming to regain control of the supernatural forces around Watashuka without public scrutiny.\n\n\n\n**1970&#039;s - Secret Investigations\n\nSecret Continuation: After Nixon&#039;s removal from office, elements within the government begin quietly restarting Project Caroline, aiming to regain control of the supernatural forces around Watashuka without public scrutiny.\n1975: OTA begins investigation into the records around Caroline College.\n1976: Special Agent Dayton Hopper goes missing during a cattle mutilation investigation.\n1978: In December, Special Agent Dayton &#039;appears&#039; at the bottom of Lake Mann. He is rescued by campus security. For him only a night had passed since his disappearance. He is mutated into a &#039;part man, part tree&#039; creature. His report was incomplete due to his death as a result of the mutation. It highlighted some cult plans around campus.\n1979: New funding allocated to Project Caroline\n\n1980&#039;s - Project Caroline Rebooted\n\n1980: Project Caroline, in secret, is restarted under OTA direction this time.\n\nWith renewed Cold War funding, Project Caroline returns, this time with a stronger focus on using the ley lines to manipulate time and space for military advantage. However, this leads to increasingly dangerous interactions with the cults, who now see the government as a direct competitor for supernatural power.\n\n\n1981: Amy Mann is recruited to the project out of graduate school. She is a genius was on path to finish her first pH.d at 21. Her field of study is the physics of time. Government influence shaved a year off of her program.\n1981:\n\nSpring: Shub-Niggurath cult begins experimenting on pregnant women at the teaching hospital.\nFall: Dave starts broadcasting &quot;Metal At Midnight&quot; on a pirate radio station.\n\n\n1982:\n\nSpring: Yog-Sothoth cult gains influence within Caroline College, increasing tensions with the Shub-Niggurath cult.\nFall: Campus radio broadcasts of &quot;Metal At Midnight&quot; become more frequent but chaotic.\n\n\n1982: Dr. Amy Mann relocates to Caroline college.\n\nDr. Amy Mann, a brilliant physicist recruited by the OTA, arrives at Caroline College to conduct experiments related to time manipulation. Unbeknownst to her, her work interacts with the ley lines and an ongoing Yog-Sothoth ritual, resulting in the creation of a time loop from 1983 to 1987.\n\n\n1983: OTA agents, including Dr. Mann hatch a plan to pose as students to gain access to sites of special interest without cult knowledge.\n1983: August 22nd, Fall semester begins at Caroline College\n1983: August 29nd, Dr. Amy Mann goes missing (presumed murdered) after witnessing a ritual by Church of the Delayed Blossom. Local start a manhunt for the student &#039;Amy Mann&#039;. In reality, Dr. Mann is pulled into an accidental time loop created by unforeseen interactions with the ritual that night and an experiment she was running in 1987.\n\nTime Loop Details: The loop resets every few years, trapping the region in a repeating cycle. The highest-ranking cultists, aware of the loop, use it to continually attempt their summoning rituals, refining their efforts with each iteration. However, they cannot fully break free from the loop without completing their final ritual.\nHo-Chunk Involvement: Ho-Chunk leaders can sense the loop and attempt to pass information from one loop to the next via dream visions, information left at ley lines and group memories.\nAmy Mann’s Role: Amy becomes the anchor for the time loop, disappearing at the start of each cycle after witnessing a cult ritual. If she can be saved or prevented from initiating the loop, the cycle can be broken, though this would only give the players a limited window to prevent the ultimate summoning of the &quot;original god.&quot;\n\n\n\n1983-1987 – Life in the loop\n\nProject Caroline continues secretly, with government agents posing as students, faculty, and local authorities. The cults remain entrenched within the college and the town, manipulating events to serve their eldritch masters.\nThe population of Watashuka continues to experience strange occurrences: hauntings, disappearances, and unexplained phenomena. The time loop ensures that no permanent damage is done, as everything resets after a few years, but the players may be able to break the cycle and uncover the true nature of the town’s cursed existence.\nEach iteration of the loop sees a &#039;shuffling&#039; of locations, events and some individuals. Key locations, events and individuals remain constant, if slightly changed.\n\nEach loop ALWAYS starts with the disappearance of Amy Mann.\n\n\n\n1987 – The Cults’ Ultimate Goal\n\nEvent: Both cults believe that 1987, specifically February 23, is the key date for completing their rituals. The alignment has not been this strong since August of 1860 (when the original school was destroyed). An alignment with the Large Magellanic Cloud provides the perfect opportunity for summoning their &quot;original god,&quot; though they do not realize this will summon Cthulhu, leading to their own destruction.\n\nEndgame: If the players fail to prevent the ritual, the time loop will break, and the full force of Cthulhu will be unleashed on the world. The cults, unaware of the true nature of their &quot;god,&quot; will be the first to be annihilated, followed by the town and eventually, the planet.\nThis has happened before: In an attempt to save humanity, Dr. Mann initiated the original time loop.\n\n\n"},"index":{"title":"RK²","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is my simple site!"}}

# Two minutes till midnight in Wisconsin...
The chill of the evening clings to the air outside. You sit alone in your dorm room, staring at the clock radio resting atop your nightstand. The green digits on your wristwatch agree with the red digits on the clock; 11:58 PM – two minutes ‘til midnight. You pull your headphones off, set your Walkman on the desk, head over to your small bed and tune into the campus radio station on the cheap alarm clock. Light classical music can be heard fading out as the DJ talks about the next piece she's putting on the turntable.
11:59 PM
A minute later the radio crackles with static and an electrical buzz. Your small room is filled with an eerie hum that seems to vibrate through your very bones. You've heard rumors of this happening before – a mysterious pirate radio station taking over the campus airwaves at precisely midnight. You've tried to catch the show before but without success. Seems tonight you got lucky.
"Let there be METAL!"
The sound of distorted guitars can be heard through the static. A disturbed metal tune, with a happy beat, begins to play.
What have you found?
After a few minutes the song ends and the host returns.
"[[Dave|Dave]] Is Back Babies! ‘Metal at Midnight’ is live and we’ve got all the music and news you need to survive this [[Watashuka|messed up little town]]. And speaking of news, we’ve got some real juicy nuggets for all you little pink faced freshmen joining our church of METAL for the first time. And believe me, its news that THEY do NOT want you to know."
He pauses only a moment to catch his breath.
"We’re going live tonight because I know some of you little metal headed sideshow freaks have got class in that torture chamber known as [[01-Campus Directory| Sister Sarah’s]]. And believe me, they are trying super hard to keep this quiet. So Dave’s going all School House Rock tonight. Knowledge is power! And power is what they don’t want you to have."
The static hangs in the air as Dave goes quiet. Is that ... screams in the static? You lean in closer, your heart pounding in your chest as the static is broken by [[Dave|Dave's]] whispered voice.
"Yeah, that hospital’s all clean and bleachy fresh outside but in the back rooms … Oh brother, it’s Mike Myers meets that freaky little alien chest baby. Us vets know it. We've heard the screams. We've seen shadows moving all weird. We've seen dumpsters getting collected late at night. Ain't no trashman working after midnight! Yeah, Sarah’s stinks alright so watch your back there. "
You glance out your window, out across the campus, towards the hospital – or rather, what you can see of it through the dense trees. The lights seem too bright tonight, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to twist and writhe unnaturally. You swear you can hear the sound of a large truck operating.
"Worst yet, THEY know it’s there! And Dave’s got the cancelled checks to prove it; right where you’d expect. In that nasty, creepy museum all the norms pass every day on their way to class. Prairie Hall is just a 24/7, 365, all you can eat charnel house with a receptionist. But they do keep records there…."
"Call Mr. King, I've got a pitch for his next book!"
The radio crackles again, and you swear you hear something else – a whispering beneath Dave's words, a dark alien presence pushing through the static. Music breaks through the small speaker again. For the next several hours metal music flows from the pirate station. Just before dawn the music stops and Dave cuts in again. You were dozing but the odd interference and the mad host's words stir you awake.
"Damn, they found me so it’s time to wrap. But before I bounce remember…"
"We’ll fight on the land,"
"We’ll fight in the fields and in the streets,"
"We’ll fight in the hills,"
"We’ll never surrender."
"Man, someone call in the metal MILITIA!"
The radio begins blaring the last song of the show. The pirate station has cranked up the volume to an almost unbearable level as heavy power chords and frantic riffs cut through the airwaves. You jump back, heart racing. As the song plays you can hear the sound of equipment being thrown into boxes. Over the din, you think you can hear Dave singing along. After a few moments, the radio station fades back into quiet static, leaving you alone with your thoughts – and the chilling echoes of Dave's words. You barely notice when the campus radio comes back on the air. Looking back out the window you can see the start of the morning's false dawn.
The night DJ has been replaced by the morning show. Soft Americana music soothes the ringing in your ears as you listen to a sorrowful woman sing over an old guitar.
_In shadows deep where whispers stir_
_A pact is forged_
_silence unheard_
_My heart I give to the darkened sky_
_To save the fields_
_to let hope fly_
_Oh hear my call_
_oh ancient dread_

## Welcome to Wisconsin.
Welcome to a world where truth hides behind conspiracy theories and history. A world where darkness lurks in the unlikeliest of places. A world where friend and foe are difficult to distinguish from one another.
Class is in session and a new semester begins tonight. Are you ready to confront the truths hidden within the hallowed halls of [[Caroline College]]?

# Summary of Literary Conceits
- **The Small Town with Dark Secrets**
	- **Conceit:** Watashuka appears to be a quaint, struggling small town in rural America—a perfect representation of quiet country life with local institutions like a Lutheran church, a college, and family-owned businesses. Beneath this peaceful façade, however, lies a hidden history of occultism, supernatural occurrences, and government conspiracies.
	- **Effect:** This conceit lures players into a familiar and nostalgic setting, only to slowly reveal its dark underbelly. The contrast between the idyllic rural setting and the creeping horror creates suspense and tension.
	- **Summary:** The familiar Americana setting contrasts with hidden cosmic horror.
- **The Time Loop**
	- **Conceit:** The entire game world is trapped in a time loop spanning 1983 to 1987, caused by a government experiment gone wrong. The loop resets every few years, with only subtle changes each time, while eldritch beings seem to exist outside of or partially immune to its effects.
	- **Effect:** The time loop gives the setting a feeling of repetition and inevitability, as the same strange occurrences and tragedies happen over and over again. It mirrors themes of **cosmic futility** and **existential horror** in the works of authors like **H.P. Lovecraft**, where humans are trapped by forces far beyond their control. For players, it introduces a puzzle-like challenge of breaking the loop to escape the repeating cycles of horror.
	- **Summary:** The repetition of events mirrors themes of cosmic futility and existential dread.
- **The "Satanic Panic" Twist**
	- **Conceit:** The 1980s fear surrounding heavy metal music and role-playing games (the "Satanic Panic") is flipped on its head. In the world of Watashuka, the very groups accused of promoting devil worship (metalheads, conspiracy theorists, gamers) are actually trying to **fight the supernatural forces** and protect the town from eldritch horrors.
	- **Effect:** This subverts the expectations of both the characters and the players, who might expect these groups to be involved with the occult. Instead, these so-called "outcasts" serve as unlikely heroes. This twist also plays into themes of **paranoia** and **misdirection**, where societal fears are focused on the wrong targets.
	- **Summary:** Metalheads and gamers are actually fighting the real occult forces, subverting 1980s fears.
- **The Conspiracy Theorist Who is Sometimes Right**
	- **Conceit:** Dave, the pirate radio host of "Metal At Midnight," serves as a wild, paranoid conspiracy theorist whose broadcasts often sound absurd. However, he occasionally stumbles onto real truths about the town’s supernatural history and ongoing conspiracies.
	- **Effect:** Dave embodies the trope of the unreliable narrator, forcing players to sift through his ramblings to find kernels of truth. His role introduces a **meta-narrative** where players must decide how much of his information to believe, knowing that even a broken clock is right twice a day.
	- **Summary:** Dave’s unreliable narration adds humor and paranoia, with glimpses of truth.
- **The Hidden Power Struggle**
	- **Conceit:** Watashuka is home to multiple factions vying for control, including cults, the government’s secret **Project Caroline**, and the Amish guardians protecting the world from supernatural forces. Each group operates in secrecy, and their true intentions are often misunderstood by the townspeople.
	- **Effect:** This creates a **layered narrative** where players are gradually drawn into a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and betrayals. The power struggle adds intrigue to the setting, with each faction hiding behind different facades (religious institutions, academic programs, local law enforcement), feeding the game’s themes of deception and the hidden truth.
	- **Summary:** Multiple factions work in secret, creating a web of deception and alliances. 
- **The Mundane Masking the Supernatural**
	- **Conceit:** Ordinary settings and objects (a biology lab, a local museum, a small-town grocery store) are used as fronts for supernatural activity and occult rituals. The familiar becomes the unfamiliar as seemingly benign places turn into sites of cosmic horror.
	- **Effect:** This literary conceit plays with the **uncanny**, creating unease by blurring the line between the mundane and the supernatural. It heightens the sense of paranoia, as players must question every normal-seeming place or person, wondering if they are tied to the dark forces manipulating the town.
	- **Summary:** Ordinary places hide eldritch rituals, blurring the line between normal and uncanny.
- **The Tension Between Religion and the Occult**
	- **Conceit:** The town’s deeply Lutheran identity is contrasted with the dark undercurrents of occult activity. The Lutheran Church is unaware of the true supernatural threats, mistakenly believing external devil worshipers are the issue while the real danger comes from cultists embedded in their own institutions.
	- **Effect:** This religious dynamic deepens the theme of **blindness to hidden dangers**. The church's misunderstanding of the threat reflects how human institutions often fail to perceive or address the true nature of evil. It also taps into the **Lovecraftian theme** of cosmic forces beyond human understanding.
	- **Summary:** The Lutheran Church misidentifies the true threat, reflecting human blindness to cosmic horror.
- **Cosmic Horror in a Small Scale**
	- **Conceit:** While the stakes involve cosmic entities and eldritch horrors, the setting focuses on small, personal stories—disappearances, strange rituals in biology labs, and eerie occurrences at a local hospital. The vastness of the threat is made more terrifying by how it plays out in an intimate, insular community.
	- **Effect:** This brings cosmic horror down to a human scale, creating a sense of helplessness as ordinary people confront unfathomable powers. The tension lies in how the town's residents unknowingly live alongside these horrors, oblivious to the full scope of what’s happening around them.
	- **Summary:** Vast cosmic threats play out in an intimate, personal setting, increasing the sense of helplessness.
- **Misinformation and Red Herrings**
	- **Conceit:** The story deliberately uses misinformation, false leads, and red herrings to mislead players and characters alike. **Amy Mann’s disappearance**, for example, serves as a red herring, diverting attention from the larger ritualistic threat posed by the cults.
	- **Effect:** This conceit adds a **puzzle-like quality** to the narrative, where players must navigate false clues and layered mysteries. The use of misinformation creates an atmosphere of distrust and confusion, contributing to the theme of **hidden truths and conspiracies**.
	- **Summary:** Red herrings and false leads create an atmosphere of paranoia and mystery.
- **The Inescapable Past**
	- **Conceit:** The region’s dark history, going back to the destruction of **Prairieville Academy**, continues to shape the present. The original rituals and occult influence haunt Watashuka, affecting every generation since.
	- **Effect:** This taps into the idea that **the past is never truly gone**, and that the evil deeds of one generation can ripple through time, affecting those who come after. The repeated cycles of the time loop reinforce this idea, symbolizing the town’s inability to escape its cursed history.
	- **Summary:** The town’s dark history continues to affect the present, symbolized by the time loop and recurring horrors.

## Character Creation
### Determining Character Stats
#### Rolling and Distributing Characteristics
For **Caroline College**, we use a variant of for determining characteristics.
1. **Roll 9 sets of (3d4+2)** and assign one of the nine sets to each of the following:    
    - Strength (**STR**)
    - Constitution (**CON**)
    - Dexterity (**DEX**)
    - Appearance (**APP**)
    - Power (**POW**)
    - Luck (**LUCK**)   
    - Size (**SIZ**)
    - Intelligence (**INT**)
    - Education (**EDU**)
Following standard Call of Cthulhu procedure, each value will be multiplied by 5 to determine the characteristic's value. 1/2 and 1/5 values can be determined from this value (except for Luck).
The goal with this system of generating characteristics is to provide a reasonable floor for character stats and a realistic upper end (you are students after all) that allows for growth throughout the campaign. Within this setting, there are numerous ways to gain increases to characters or bonuses.
## House Rules
There are a number of house rules used in this campaign setting, including optional ones.
See:
- [[01-House Rule-Distress Points (DSP)|Optional House Rule: Distress Points]]
- [[02-House Rule-School Life|House Rule: School Life]] 
---
## Mechanics Adjustments
The following are a list of adjustments, clarifications, and exercised options available in the Call Of Cthulhu system that are made use of in Caroline College.
### Sanity Loss Adjustments
- **Reading Mythos Tomes**:
    - Costs sanity but **will not trigger bouts of madness or insanity** if done in a safe environment.
### Recovery from Indefinite Insanity
Students at Caroline College have access to **counseling sessions** provided by the local Lutheran church. These sessions are non-religious and aim to aid students in recovering from indefinite insanity and trauma.
- **Weekly Counseling Sessions**:
    - **Availability**: Once per week, when not participating in a game session. This is the same as Call of Cthulhu recovery method in all ways except the frequency (weekly as opposed to monthly).
    - **Sanity Recovery Mechanics**:
        - **Recovery Attempt**:
            - Roll percentile dice (1d100).
            - On a result of **01–95**:
                - **Success**: Recover **1d10 Sanity Points**.
            - On a result of **96–100**:
                - **Setback**:
                    - Lose **1d6 Sanity Points**.
                    - Gain a **new phobia** related to the stress or topics discussed during counseling.
        - **Resolving Indefinite Insanity**:
            - If Sanity Points are gained during a counseling session, you may immediately make a Sanity check (using your updated Sanity score).
            - On a **Hard Success**, your indefinite insanity is resolved.
    - **Time Commitment**:
        - Attending a counseling session requires an in-game time slot, potentially conflicting with classes or investigations.
    - **Keeper's Note**:
        - Frequent therapy sessions may draw attention or have narrative implications, adding to the tension of balancing time.
        - **Failed Therapy Sessions**:
            - May induce phobias related to the therapy content, providing additional story hooks.
### Luck Recovery and Advancement
**Luck advancements** are made at the **start of every game session**.
- **Luck Recovery Mechanics**:
    - **Improvement Check**:
        - Roll 1d100.
        - If the roll is **above** your current Luck, add **1d10 points**.
        - If the roll is equal to or less than your current Luck, no points are recovered.
- **Note**:
    - Luck may not exceed 99.
    - The starting Luck value is not used again in the game.
### Skill Advancements
**Skill advancements** are made after thematically appropriate breaks, as determined by the keeper (expect **3–5 per semester, including exams**).
### PvP Interactions and Loss of Control
- **Player vs. Player (PvP) 'Attacks'**:
    - Must be made with **consent** of all involved players.
- **Loss of Control Situations**:
    - Occur when a character is under the effects of insanity, a Breakdown due to Distress, or certain supernatural influences.
    - Actions are at the keeper's discretion.
    - The keeper should consider player enjoyment and strive for consensual storytelling.
### Backstory Connections
- **Robust and Thematically Appropriate Backstories**:
    - Include one or more entries with a **dark element**.
    - Develop meaningful locations, significant people, and pivotal events that add depth.
- **Character Connections**:
    - Every character must have a connection to **at least two other characters** in the party in their backstory.
    - No character can have more than two connections to them.
### Group Skill Checks
- **Assisting with Skill Rolls**:
    - If more than one character attempts a skill roll for the same task, under pressure:
        - If at least **two characters have skill above baseline**, one person can make the roll with a **Bonus Die**.
### Spending Luck
- **Luck Points** can be spent to alter the result of a skill or characteristic roll on a **1-for-1 basis**.
- **Restrictions**:
    - Cannot spend Luck on:
        - Luck rolls
        - Damage rolls
        - Sanity rolls
        - Rolls to determine the amount of Sanity points lost
    - Cannot spend Luck on **Pushed Rolls**.
    - **Critical, Fumbles, and Firearm Malfunctions** cannot be altered with Luck.
    - **No skill improvement check** is earned if Luck was used to alter the roll.

## Character Creation Advice
This section is not about rule modifications or clarifications. Instead, it is advice for how to get the most out of your character's time at Caroline College. Every setting has tropes and archetypes and a game set in the early 80's in the Midwest of the United States is no different. So here is some advise for making characters that fit the feel of Caroline College.
### Hopefuls, Not Heroes. 
This is a story of people who got in over their heads and either rose to the occasion or failed in the most memorable way possible. Is it possible to make a character that has millions of dollars in assets available to them, the ears of kings and presidents, and was a former super solider work in the setting? Maybe. Would it [[!How I Play#Respecting the Mood|respect the mood]] of the setting. Absolutely not.
#### Character Ideas and Suggestions For Players Who Don't Know Where To Start
- **Get Dirty:** Remember that this is a horror game with a setting that assumes **no one** is pure and innocent. Everyone in Watashuka has a skeleton in their closet; even you. The size of this skeleton, and how far back in the closet it is, is up to you; but its there. For some it might be minor and public; youthful drug use that left a mark on you that you don't deny, a problem with juvie as a child that you'd rather not talk about, something. 
	- **Why?** Because just like a fantasy game where your character is expected to take wounds and recover, a horror game inflicts wounds too. But when those wound happen, it is more interesting, and hopefully fun, to have a way to show those wounds by more than a number in a box. Call of Cthulhu works best when the backstory is the most important page on the character sheet. As horrors rend your mind, your backstory changes. New facts become 'discovered' about your past. It is much more meaningful to have a fertile bed ready for this than just a blank sheet and rolled phobia.
	- **DO NOT USE THE GAME AS THERAPY.** It is tempting for some people to use real life, lived pain, as a basis for a character's backstory. Don't do this. We are gamers, not therapists. While it may be cathartic for you, it is not for your fellow table-mates.
- **Ask before touching:** The NPCs in the setting can be a great way of tying your character into the setting early on. While we have tried to add dozens and dozens of NPCs that you might know, some of these NPCs have backstories of their own. Work with the Keeper BEFORE fleshing out an elaborate back story involving you being the long lost child of an NPCs who never had children. By asking first, the Keeper can help find an appropriate way to tie you into the game. They may even be able to help you weave new lore of the world!
- **Don't Be Afraid To Be New:** The College actively recruits people from outside the region. Maybe you have no ties to the region. Maybe you are here as a last resort - the failing student who got a surprise full-ride scholarship to a little school in the middle of nowhere. Or perhaps you are running from something back home, something you would like to stay far away. Work with your Keeper as needed.
- **Don't 'Cheat':** "*Well, my character has connection to X so I should already know all about Y and Z.*". Or "*I'm the Q's daughter so I should be able to just walk into the secret meeting.*" This is a game of horror and horror means the unknown. Don't try to engineer a character that takes the fun out of the horror but circumventing it. We aren't here to 'win', we are here to play.
- **Embrace The Unknown:** If you are at Caroline College, you deserve to be at Caroline College. Rise above the madness by investigating it.
##### Example Starting Points For Characters
If you need them, take inspiration from the following. Mix, match, ignore, add to, etc. 
- **Small-Town Legacy** – A freshman who grew up hearing stories of their uncle's disappearance while working the night shift at _[[WCTU]]_ (notice all the hosts that are 'replacements'). They’re studying journalism, determined to find out what happened, but their family warns them against digging too deep.
- **New School, New Dreams, right?**: Maybe if I leave the state the dreams will stop. Maybe I won't drop out my first semester, again. Maybe a psychology major will help me remember the dreams I can't recall. Maybe it will help me forget them altogether.
- **Amateur Cryptid Hunter** – A kid who grew up on Ripley's and "In Search Of...".  Fascinated by rumors of cryptid sightings around Lake Geneva and Watashuka decides to major in biology to see if its even possible.
- **The Journalist’s Protégé** – A journalism major with a passion for uncovering the truth. They landed an early internship at _The Prairie Press_ under [[Norm Habersham]], but they've started to receive strange anonymous tips and can't shake the feeling they’re being watched.
- **The Former Delinquent** – Fresh out of high school, you barely scraped into college after a troubled past at North High (how did that happen). You’re trying to start fresh, but a broken home is hard to over come. Especially with spending all your life hearing hints that mom and dad knew more about what went down at South High that night. 
- **The Reluctant Believer** – A history major, raised by a strict religious family, who grew up hearing warnings about occult forces infiltrating Caroline College. Not a founding member, but a passionate one, your grandfather made sure you heard all of [[Mothers Opposing Metal|Mothers Opposing Metal's]] warnings. But now that you are on campus, you can’t help but notice strange things, particularly in St. John’s Chapel, that remind you of his warnings.
- **The Absent Minded Pre-Med Student?** – You've always been drawn to medicine, and was a promising student. But now that you are on campus it seems you can't remember where you put your stuff. And there must be allergies in your dorm because you wake up with nose bleeds... a lot.
- **The Photographer with a Problem** – A freshman art major with a passion for photography. Maybe the school will help you go to the next level... and finally learn how to stop getting that odd light smudge that sometimes show up in your pictures when you take photos of certain places.
- **Maybe Dad Was Right** – The child of a longtime Watashuka resident, you grew up hearing stories about strange happenings around Lake Mary, particularly from your eccentric family members. Now that you’re attending Caroline College, you’re starting to wonder if those stories might be more than just local myths.
- **Absentee Grandfather** - You are here. Therefore, you had a father. That's just science right? And that means he had a father; it follows. Then why is the last mention of my grandfather, anywhere in town, a baptism record from before WW2?
- **The Hesitant Explorer** – An outdoor enthusiast who joined Caroline College’s Adventure Club, eager to explore the forests around the town. Maybe you'll get a chance to see the creature that licked your palm clean of blood when you feel down that ravine when you were a kid. Too bad the scout guides scared it away before you could see more than its tongue.
- **The Quiet Music Major** – Drawn to the _Don Peachy Center for the Performing Arts_, you quickly discover that perfect pitch doesn't mean that someone in in your head telling you what to play when under stress.
### Backstory Elements
Developing a rich backstory adds depth to your character and enhances the gaming experience. Each character should create entries for the following areas, aiming for meaningful and engaging content. This is a horror game, so dark elements within a backstory is acceptable, thematically appropriate, and strongly encouraged (within the limits defined by Session Zero). Try to remember that your characters don't know what's happening in the setting yet; hints and suggestions go a long way!
#### Ideology/Beliefs
- **Bad Example**: "I believe in justice."
    - _Why it's bad_: Too vague and generic; lacks depth.
- **Acceptable Example**: "I believe that the legal system is flawed, and true justice can only be achieved outside of it."
    - _Why it's acceptable_: Adds complexity and hints at potential conflicts.
- **Good Example**: "Ethan prowls the city's backstreets at night, where justice rarely reaches. When the courts failed him and the guilty walked free, he wasn't above bending the rules to set things right. To him, the law is just a guideline, and true justice sometimes requires a darker path that others might deem questionable."
    - _Why it's good_: Provides depth, aligns with game themes, and introduces moral ambiguity.
#### Significant People
- **Bad Example**: "My mother."
    - _Why it's bad_: Too general; doesn't explain significance.
- **Acceptable Example**: "My mother, who supported my academic pursuits."
    - _Why it's acceptable_: Offers context but lacks depth.
- **Good Example**: "Amelia carries a tattered letter from her estranged mother, filled with unsent words of apology. She reads it under dim lamplight, wondering about the life her mother chose over her family. Each word fuels Amelia's resolve to find her, not just to reconnect, but to understand the choices that led them apart."
    - _Why it's good_: Adds personal stakes, urgency, and ties to potential plot lines.
#### Meaningful Locations
- **Bad Example**: "The park."
    - _Why it's bad_: Too vague; lacks meaningful context.
- **Acceptable Example**: "The old park near my childhood home where I used to play."
    - _Why it's acceptable_: Provides some context but lacks depth.
- **Good Example**: "The rusted remains of the old Ferris wheel loom over the deserted fairground, a place where Lucas once shared a fleeting moment of joy with his first love before she moved away without a word. He returns there, the silence heavy with memories and unanswered questions, hoping one day to recapture that lost connection or at least find closure."
    - _Why it's good_: Rich atmosphere, ties into supernatural elements, and profoundly impacts the character.
#### Treasured Possessions
- **Bad Example**: "A book."
    - _Why it's bad_: Generic; doesn't reveal anything about the character.
- **Acceptable Example**: "An old diary from my grandmother."
    - _Why it's acceptable_: Provides a familial connection but could be more detailed.
- **Good Example**: "Lily discovered an old, leather-bound book hidden behind a loose brick in her grandmother's fireplace. The pages are filled with faded handwriting and strange symbols she doesn't understand. As she reads, unsettling family secrets begin to surface—stories of forgotten ancestors and choices that cast long shadows over her family's history, secrets they had tried desperately to keep buried. At least she knows she isn't alone in her bad choices."
    - _Why it's good_: Deeply personal, tied to game lore, and serves as a catalyst for adventures.

# Session Zero Guidelines
### Starting Campaigns
We begin new campaigns with a **Session Zero** to:
- Align expectations.
- Discuss boundaries.
- Establish the tone.
- Integrate characters into the world.
### Backstories
- **Characters Should Not Start as Heroes**:
    - Focus on backstories that plant seeds for future adventures.
    - Avoid having characters who have already achieved greatness.
### Fitting the Tone
- Ensure your character fits the **theme of the campaign** (early 1980's horror sit in small town America).
### Party Dynamics
- **Create Characters That Fit the Party**:
    - Develop strong connections with at least two other characters.
    - Collaborate during character creation to ensure cohesion.
    - Come to session zero with ideas, not characters.
### Respecting the Mood
- **Maintain Immersion**:
    - Avoid breaking tension with out-of-place jokes, side talk, etc..
    - Engage with the core themes agreed upon.
### Rule of Cool
- **Story Over Rules**: We'll follow the Rule of Cool to prioritize narrative over strict rule adherence.
### Improvisation and Player Agency
- **Your Actions Shape the Story**:
    - Major events occur based on your decisions.
    - Creativity is rewarded, even if payoffs aren't immediate.
    - Not every encounter is balanced; sometimes avoiding conflict is wise.
### Player Preparation
- **Stay Engaged**:
    - Be attentive during sessions.
    - Review notes between sessions.
    - Keep your character curious and involved.
- **Session Recaps**:
    - Before each session, a player provides a recap of the previous session (group's choosing).
    - **Incentive**:
        - The player who provides the recap gains a **one-time Bonus Die** for the session (unused bonus dice do not roll over).
### Safety Tools

    - **Session Zero**: Establish comfort levels and boundaries.
    - **Lines & Veils**:
        - **Lines**: Hard limits not to be crossed.

        - Tap the X card to immediately stop and change uncomfortable content.
    - **Consent Flowers**:
        - **Green**: Keep going.
        - **Yellow**: Proceed with caution.
        - **Red**: Change the subject.
- **Examples**:

### Themes and Boundaries
- **Discuss Sensitive Topics**:
    - Be proactive in expressing preferences.
    - Common topics include violence, discrimination, sexuality, and personal phobias.
### Conflict Resolution
- **In-Character Conflict**:
    - Should serve the narrative.
    - Avoid actions that disrupt group dynamics.
- **Out-of-Character Conflict**:
    - Address issues respectfully among yourselves.
    - The keeper is a storyteller, not a mediator.
### Role-Playing
- **Immerse Yourself**:
    - Act and speak as your character.
    - Avoid phrases like "My character does X."

# Optional Expanded Sanity Rules for Call of Cthulhu
_Note: These rules are optional and will be discussed during Session Zero. They are designed to enhance the horror experience in long-term campaigns without incapacitating characters through excessive Sanity loss._
*These rules were heavily inspired by the work Apostol Apostolov at [## Chaosium Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition House Rules](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Mjep4ji0GZdmV57OMGg)*
For details on making characters see [[01-Characters-Caroline|Character Creation]]
## Introduction
The Expanded Sanity Rules introduce a new mechanic called **Distress Points (DSP)** to add psychological depth and realism to our game. Like standard Sanity Points (SAN), which decrease as characters encounter supernatural horrors, Distress Points start at a maximum value and decrease as characters face stress from realistic, non-supernatural threats. This allows characters to handle man-made horrors and stressful situations without immediate risk of madness.
## Distress Points (DSP)
### What Are Distress Points?
- **Distress Points** represent your character's mental resilience to stress from non-supernatural situations, such as tough decisions, resource scarcity, or dangerous environments.
- Every character starts with DSP equal to their **POW** (similar to how SAN is calculated).
### Losing Distress Points
- **Non-Supernatural Encounters**: Non-supernatural horrors cause DSP loss instead of SAN loss. This would replace the traditional sanity roll for these mundane encounters.
- **Stressful Situations**: When facing non-horrific, but still stress situations, DSP checks may need to be made.
- **SAN Rolls**: Making a sanity roll, by definition, is caused by a situation that is stressful. You lose a a DSP every time a sanity roll is made; pass or fail.
- **Voluntary SAN Damage**: You can always choose to take SAN damage instead of losing DSP, but not the reverse.
### Effects of Distress Points
- **Above Half DSP** (more than half of your maximum DSP): You remain composed; your hidden traits are under control.
- **Equal to or Below Half DSP** (half or less of your maximum DSP):
    - Begin to show minor signs of stress linked to your **Dark Trait**.
    - Each time you lose 5 or more DSP at once, roll against your current DSP. If you roll equal to or less than your DSP, you experience a **Breakdown** for 1d4 rounds.
- **Equal to or Below One-Fifth DSP** (one-fifth or less of your maximum DSP):
    - Your behavior is noticeably affected by your Dark Trait.
    - Breakdowns last longer (1d10 rounds), and the Keeper may suggest actions for your character.
- **At Zero DSP**:
    - You suffer a **Complete Breakdown**.
    - The Keeper may take control of your character until DSP is recovered.
### Maximum DSP
- **DSP cannot exceed your starting value** (POW). Rest and recovery can help you regain lost DSP up to this maximum.
## Example of a Breakdown
### **Scenario**:
Maria, an investigator with a starting POW of 60, starts with **DSP = 60**. Her **Dark Trait** is **Paranoia**, which she keeps hidden from the rest of the team.
### Events Leading to the Breakdown:
1. **Initial Stress**:    
    - Maria and her team are exploring an abandoned asylum.
    - She encounters realistic but disturbing graffiti and unsettling noises.
    - Over time, she loses **20 DSP**, reducing her DSP to **40**.
2. **DSP at Half Maximum**:
    - Since her DSP is now at **40** (which is two-thirds of 60), she remains composed.
3. **Further Stress**:
    - The team finds a room with detailed accounts of past tortures (non-supernatural).
    - Maria loses **15 DSP** due to the distressing content, bringing her DSP down to **25**.
4. **DSP Falls to Half or Less**:
    - With DSP at **25** (less than half of 60), she begins to show minor signs of her Dark Trait (Paranoia).
    - She starts questioning the intentions of her teammates subtly.
5. **Triggering a Breakdown**:
    - Suddenly, a realistic but horrific trap is sprung, causing Maria to lose **10 DSP** at once, dropping her DSP to **15**.
    - Because she lost **5 or more DSP at once** and her DSP is below half, she must roll against her current DSP (**15**).
        - She rolls a **22**, which is above her DSP.
        - **Breakdown Triggered**: The Breakdown will last **1d4 rounds** (let's say she rolls a 3).
### During the Breakdown:
- **Behavior**:    
    - For the next **3 rounds**, Maria's paranoia takes over.
    - She becomes convinced that one of her teammates is sabotaging the mission.
    - She might accuse them openly, refuse to share information, or even act defensively if approached.
- **Keeper's Role**:    
    - The Keeper reminds Maria's player of her Dark Trait and suggests actions that reflect her heightened paranoia.
    - The player can choose how to role-play these suggestions within the confines of the Breakdown.
### After the Breakdown:
- Maria's DSP remains at **15**.
- She regains some composure but still shows signs of stress.
- The team may notice her odd behavior, and she might need to find ways to recover DSP.
## Dark Traits
### What Are Dark Traits?
- **Dark Traits** are hidden aspects of your character's personality that emerge under stress.
- They add depth to your character and provide role-playing opportunities.
### Selecting a Dark Trait
- Choose a Dark Trait during character creation. It should remain secret from other players but not the keeper.
- Examples include traits like paranoia, obsession, aggression, or compulsiveness.
- Your Dark Trait influences how your character behaves as DSP decreases.
### Revealing Dark Traits
- As DSP decreases, subtle behaviors linked to your Dark Trait begin to surface.
- Under severe stress or during Breakdowns, these traits may dominate your actions.
## Managing Distress
- **Rest and Relaxation**:
    - **Short Rest**: Resting for at least an hour in a safe, comfortable environment restores **1d10 DSP**. This cannot be repeated until at least one point of DSP has been lost.
    - **Extended Rest**: A **full** day of rest restores **10 DSP** (may be repeated as needed).
- **Composure Attempts**:
    - **POW Roll**: Attempt a POW roll to compose yourself. If your current DSP is at or below half maximum, the roll is of Hard difficulty.
    - **Success**: Restores **1d4 DSP** during danger or **1d6+1 DSP** when safe.
- **Assistance from Allies**:
    - Another character can use a **Psychology** roll to help you recover.
    - Success has the same effects as a successful POW roll. These cannot be used in conjugation. But if one fails, the other may be attempted. 
- **Indulging in Manias**:
    - Engaging in a personal mania restores **1d6+1 DSP**.
    - Requires a Sanity roll; failure results in **1 SAN loss**.
### Pacing Stress Loss
- To keep gameplay smooth, DSP losses can be accumulated over a scene and applied at the end.
- This minimizes interruptions and maintains narrative flow.
- Immediate DSP losses may still occur during sudden shocks or critical moments.
### Increased Impact of Phobias
- If your character has a **Phobia**, encountering its trigger doubles any DSP losses.
## Purpose of These Rules
- **Enhanced Role-Playing**: Allows for deeper character development as hidden traits surface under stress.
- **Balanced Horror Experience**: Maintains the horror atmosphere without quickly incapacitating characters through massive Sanity loss.
- **Long-Term Campaign Suitability**: Ideal for extended play, where character arcs and psychological journeys are explored over time.
## Conclusion
Please consider how these rules might enhance your gaming experience. They aim to add psychological realism and depth to our campaign, offering new challenges and role-playing opportunities without overwhelming your character with Sanity loss. We'll discuss these rules in detail during Session Zero to ensure everyone is comfortable and understands how they will be integrated into our game.

title: "House Rule: School Life"
draft: false
publish: true
tags:
  - TTRPG
  - Horror
---
**Recommendation**: Playing a character < = 39 years old is thematically appropriate. But nothing is stopping you from making a feisty middle-ager or spunky retiree. Just *work with the party*  to explain why these generationally disparate people are spending so much time together.
# House Rule: School Life
In this campaign, players must balance academic responsibilities with their mystery-solving adventures. Attending class not only helps avoid failing grades but also provides in-game bonuses through skill improvements.
See [[01-Characters-Caroline|Character Creation]] for more details about making a character in the world of Caroline College.
## Making The Grade
- **Class Selection**: Each player must choose 5 classes each semester.
	- Freshman Fall Semester: 
		- 3 **required classes**: One science, one history, and one language.
		- 2 **optional classes**: Chosen from the list of electives.
- **Passing a Class**:
	- Two exams will be held during the semester: a mid-term and a final
		- Making the mid-term advancement will grant a 'penalty' die on the final
			- As you want to 'fail' an advancement roll, the penalty die is a benefit 
	- Passing an exam involves making an advancement roll in the relative topic
		- *Luck may be used on this roll!* If you use luck to pass either of the two exams, you forfeit ALL advancements rolls from the course as well as attendance bonus.
			- Sometimes passing is more important.
	- Courses covering multiple skills
		- If a course covers multiple skills, then the player which ONE skill they will make the advancement for; not both
		- Different skills may be selected for the mid-term and final
- **Failing Classes**
	- Two consecutive semesters with five or fewer classes pass may result in academic probation. 
		- This can cause the student to lose access to campus facilities (including clubs and organizations), story line options, or other narrative consequences
- **Honor Roll**
	- Two consecutive semesters with 10 or more passed classes may result in honor role-playing
		- This may cause the character to gain access to new campus facilities, people, permissions and other bonuses.
- **Class Attendance**
	- Attending classes regularly will grant **+5%** to the relative skill at the end of the semester. 
		- This is in addition to the advancements made from the mid-term and final.
		- In courses that involve more than one skill, points will be distributed between the skills as the player wishes.
	- Meeting the attendance requirement, but failing a class, will still grant the bonus (you at least learned *something* by showing up).
	- All courses have a college required 70% attendance policy for all held classes.
		- Meeting this requirement is determined narratively.
- **Tension Mechanic**: Players must choose between attending classes or pursuing adventures, balancing academic success with their investigations.
## Limited Occupation: College Student
**All** characters at Caroline College use the occupation **College Student**.
- **Occupation Skill Points**: EDU × 3 (Reduced from the standard to reflect starting students but with more opportunities for advancement during the campaign).
- **Credit Rating**: 5–10
- **Suggested Contacts**: Other students.
- **Skills**:
    - Language (Own or Other)
    - Library Use
    - Listen
    - **Three Fields of Study** (choose three academic skills relevant to your character's studies)

# Keeper Version
**Truth Behind the Legend:** While many believe Prairie Hall may be a reconstruction, it is, in fact, the original building, saved through unexplained means during the destruction of Prairieville Academy in 1860. The truth behind the event is linked to an occult ritual that went awry, resulting in the deaths of most of the academy’s founders. Only Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling survived. They rebuilt the school but buried the darker parts of their history. The public story that the building was saved is a carefully crafted lie.
**Basements:** The first two basement levels are part of the museum, as players might expect. However, deeper below lies a third and fourth level, dug out in the 1930s under the guise of expanding storage. These lower levels house documents and artifacts that hint at the occult origins of the academy, including cryptic texts, old ritual tools, and records of the supernatural events surrounding the academy's early days.
The **fourth basement** is particularly well-guarded, constructed with reinforced steel walls thicker than most bomb shelters. This floor is sealed, locked behind layers of security systems. Inside are disturbing remnants of past experiments carried out by the college in the 1930s. These secret records confirm the existence of ancient cults that have influenced Caroline College since its inception. Evidence of the college’s involvement in dark rituals, including summoning practices, are hidden away, never meant to see the light of day.
**Dave’s Claim:** As mentioned in the broadcasts of _Metal at Midnight_, Dave believes that dark secrets are buried beneath Prairie Hall. While many dismiss his claims, he is unknowingly close to the truth. The fourth basement holds proof of occult rituals conducted by past members of the academy, along with records of darker, hidden events that have shaped the town. Dave’s belief that these documents could expose something sinister is entirely accurate, though no one has dared to investigate further.

# Overview
![[Prairie Hall with the Qubit Tower in the background.png]]
*Prairie Hall with the Qubit Tower in the background.*
Prairie Hall is a small, historical log cabin located at the heart of [[Caroline College|Caroline College]] campus. Originally built in 1856 as part of Prairieville Academy, it holds the distinction of being the first permanent structure associated with the college. Over the years, it has served various functions but is now preserved as a museum celebrating the early history of the school and the surrounding region.
The building is 20' x 12' and features simple, frontier-style construction with logs and a stone chimney. Inside, visitors will find artifacts from the 19th century, including tools, books, and furnishings that reflect early Wisconsin pioneer life. The museum provides a glimpse into the lives of the school’s founders and the region’s history. Below the cabin, two basement levels house additional exhibits and storage, where older records and artifacts are carefully maintained for educational purposes.
The Prairie Hall Museum is a favorite among history majors and tourists alike, offering a quiet retreat from the busier parts of campus. Some students debate whether the current building is the original cabin or a reconstruction following its near destruction during the 1860 conflict that devastated the academy. While it’s a topic of discussion, no official documents confirm either theory.

# Keeper Version
While [[WCTU]] appears to be a typical college radio station, it harbors a darker purpose. Some of its broadcasts, especially during the late-night shifts, carry hidden occult messages. These messages, usually masked by the music or obscured by garbled signals, often serve as instructions for cult members or warnings for impending rituals. Certain broadcasts can trigger mild time distortions or altered states of consciousness in listeners.
- **Location**: The cramped basement of the McElhenney Journalism School is an ideal spot for covert activities. Its labyrinth of storage rooms and soundproofed walls make it perfect for cult meetings, occult rituals, and other secretive actions without drawing attention from the broader campus.
- **Cult Influence**: The station is influenced by _The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled_, a cult that seeks to manipulate time and space. Michelina Plum’s "Night Vibes" is known to have a hypnotic effect on listeners, occasionally allowing subtle time manipulations or even moments of déjà vu in those who regularly tune in.
- **Disappearing DJs**: Several DJs, particularly those working the night shift, have mysteriously vanished over the years. The local authorities attribute these disappearances to accidents or students running away, but in truth, these individuals often stumbled too close to the station’s secret purpose and were silenced by the cult.
- **Hidden Broadcasts**: Occasionally, WCTU picks up strange signals late at night—cryptic voices, eerie sounds, or broadcasts that seem to originate from other times. Some of these signals are accidental, while others are deliberate messages sent by cultists to guide or summon members.
- **Game Hooks**:
    - A DJ disappears after a late-night broadcast, and their last words over the airwaves were cryptic and unsettling, leading the players to investigate.
    - The players receive a strange transmission while listening to WCTU, full of static and distorted voices, giving them clues to the next stage of their investigation.
    - Old WCTU broadcasts contain secret messages pointing to occult rituals and locations hidden within the town of Watashuka.
By day, WCTU is a quirky, student-run station, but by night, it becomes a subtle tool of occult manipulation, with its signals influencing the town and its students in dangerous ways.
### **Notes on Replacements (Past 12 Months)**

### **Dr. Amy Mann (Ph.D. Physicist, Government Operative)**
![[Dr. Amy Mann ID Photo.jpg]]
- **Background**: Dr. Amy Mann is a prodigy, having completed her doctorate in temporal physics by the age of 21. Recruited by the _Office of Technological Assessment (OTA)_ right out of graduate school, she has been sent to Watashuka under the guise of a faculty member at Caroline College. Her groundbreaking research on time manipulation is of great interest to Project Caroline, which seeks to exploit the ley lines for military use. Unbeknownst to her, Amy's work is directly tied to the eldritch forces lurking beneath the town.
- **Age**: 23 (1983)
- **Appearance**: Amy's striking presence is one of grace and intelligence. She has delicate yet determined features: fair skin with a soft glow, large expressive blue-green eyes framed by long lashes, and golden-blonde hair that cascades in soft waves. Despite her brilliance, she maintains an air of innocence and naivety about the world beyond academia. Amy often dresses in professional yet understated attire, favoring dark, minimalist outfits with sharp collars, as if her clothing reflects the precision of her scientific mind.
- **Personality**: While exceptionally intelligent and focused, Amy is quiet and introspective, preferring the company of her research over socializing. She tends to be reserved, avoiding unnecessary attention, but is passionate about solving the mysteries of time and the universe. Her curiosity is both her greatest strength and her undoing, as it leads her deeper into the occult forces she doesn’t fully comprehend. Despite her genius, in 1983, she has a vulnerable side—being so young, Amy is still somewhat naïve about the political and supernatural machinations surrounding her.
- **Connections**:    
    - Project Caroline: Amy was recruited by the OTA to work on secretive government experiments tied to time manipulation and the ley lines beneath Watashuka. Her research is invaluable to the project, though she is unaware of the true extent of the eldritch entities that influence both her work and the town.
- **Fate**: Amy disappears on **August 29, 1983**, after witnessing a ritual by Church of the Delayed Blossom. Her disappearance is the catalyst for the time loop that resets the town’s reality every few years. In each cycle, Amy’s fate is sealed—whether she is killed, pulled into another dimension, or sacrificed. She unknowingly serves as the **temporal anchor** for the loop, her life and death entwined with the supernatural forces at play.
- **Role in the Time Loop**: As the anchor, Amy is crucial to breaking the loop. Players may encounter echoes of her throughout different cycles, or even uncover fragmented memories she has left behind in the form of notes, messages, or recorded experiments. If they can save her or prevent her disappearance, they might find a way to disrupt the cycle—though doing so may unleash even greater dangers.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:    
    - **Missing Person**: Investigators can be drawn into the mystery by following leads related to her disappearance, piecing together her connection to Project Caroline and the cults.
    - **Personal Journals**: Amy’s research journals, scattered throughout Watashuka, contain clues not only to her scientific work but also to the rituals and cults operating around her. Some pages may hold cryptic notes that reveal her growing awareness of the loop.
    - **Visions and Dreams**: Amy may appear to players in dreams, fragmented across time, desperately trying to warn them about what’s to come. These visions often carry a sense of urgency but are incomplete, leaving the players to fill in the blanks.
- **Final Goal**: Breaking the time loop requires either rescuing Amy from her fate or successfully completing the temporal experiments that trapped the town in the first place. However, even if she is saved, the eldritch horrors may still find a way to break through the fabric of reality.
	- If the cults ever break free from the time loop and are able to complete their ritual, which must happen on 23 Feb 1987, just as a new light source in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) reaches Earth, they will awaken their 'original god'. What they do not understand is that this 'original god', Cthulhu, will, as a first act, wipe out all of the cults... then the region, then the world.
	- This happened in at least two iterations of the time loop
		- Amy initiated the time loop on purpose to stop such an event with the hope that she and her team could disrupt the ritual from ever being able to be completed. Unfortunately, her presence at a major cult ritual became the anchor for one end of the loop; her initiating it became the other. She is stuck at the two ends of the loop unable to warning anyone about the dangers our the consequence of failure. 
	- Each iteration of the time loop shuffles the initial conditions and as such people, places and events may change. But each campaign starts with a ritual that Amy is present for, and her disappearance shortly after that. If Amy's disappearance could be stopped, the time loop is broken. But the players would still have only a few years to stop the final ritual.

  - TTRPG

**[[Dr. Daniel J. Stanton]]**  
**President of Caroline College (1974-Present)**  
**Class of 1937**
**Physical Description**: Dr. Stanton is a tall man, standing around 6'2", with silvering hair slicked back in an old-fashioned style. He has a robust build but carries himself with the stiff, formal posture of someone used to authority. His dark suits are always tailored, emphasizing his wealth and status. His hands are frequently adorned with gold rings, and his confident, almost smirking expression hides the ambition that drives him.
Dr. Stanton's rise to the presidency of Caroline College in 1974 was orchestrated by the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]** as part of a larger strategy to eliminate government interference, particularly Project Caroline, from the campus. This move coincided with the Nixon administration’s decision to withdraw the project, a victory for the cult and a step forward in their manipulation of the college.
Stanton himself is not a cultist but has become a convenient puppet for the Church. His obsession with wealth and fame makes him easy to manipulate. He despises big government, despite the fact that his entire fortune is rooted in post-war contracts and lucrative deals with government agencies during the economic boom. Stanton’s import business after WWII, which involved Asian markets, helped him accumulate vast wealth, largely due to questionable dealings, though he publicly spins this as his contribution to the war effort.
**Cult Handler**: **Margaret "Maggie" Laurent**  
Margaret Laurent, posing as a senior faculty member in the business department, is Stanton’s handler within the Church of the Delayed Blossom. A high-ranking cult member, Maggie has been placed strategically close to Stanton, feeding him suggestions and using flattery and promises of fame to keep him on the path the cult desires. She interacts with him subtly, using faculty meetings, casual dinners, and business advice to maintain her influence without raising suspicion. Maggie is adept at framing her manipulations as if they align with Stanton’s personal ambitions, ensuring that he remains unaware of her true motives.
**World War II Role**: Stanton did not serve in the war but instead profited from it, establishing lucrative import contracts and expanding his business empire under the guise of contributing to post-war recovery. This narrative has been spun into a tale of patriotic duty, allowing Stanton to position himself as a supporter of the war effort despite his opportunistic profiteering.
**Personality**: Stanton is driven by personal ambition. Though he is competent at managing the college, his real interest lies in furthering his own reputation and amassing more wealth. The cult knows this and uses it to their advantage, keeping him focused on business expansions and financial growth rather than delving too deeply into the college’s darker undercurrents. He let's people believe that he is too humble to put on his CV the name of the university he got his honorary doctorate from; preferring them to assume it was Harvard or MIT. It was Miskatonic. And it was part of business business bribe engineered but the Church of the Delayed Blossom. It is also more than passingly racist against people of Asian heritage. 
**Influence by the Cult**: Stanton's anti-government stance, though seemingly personal, is shaped by the Church of the Delayed Blossom. They use his paranoia about big government to keep him aligned with their goals, particularly the removal of any remaining government presence at Caroline College.

[[Katherine Coates]]
**Role/Title:**  
Head of the Journalism Department at Caroline College, Faculty Advisor for _The Crier_  
Unwitting protector of the college’s secrets, blind to the supernatural forces at play
**Description:**  
Professor Katherine Coates is an idealist at heart, believing that journalism can be a force for good in the world. However, her idealism has left her with significant blind spots. Katherine is completely unaware of the darker forces at work within [[Caroline College]] and [[Watashuka]]. She suspects there is some level of governmental corruption on campus—perhaps linked to outdated funding agreements with the now-defunct [[Watashuka Initiative]] —but she dismisses any talk of supernatural occurrences or secret experiments as conspiracy theories.
**Her Role in the Cover-Up:**  
In her attempts to protect the integrity of the journalism department, Katherine has inadvertently contributed to the very problems she’s trying to solve. She is particularly frustrated by the ongoing pirate radio broadcasts from **[[WCTU]]**, which she sees as a blemish on the college’s reputation. Katherine has gone so far as to deny the existence of these broadcasts to administrators, assuming they are nothing more than rebellious pranks. In doing so, she has unknowingly shielded some of the college’s more dangerous underground activities, including the cult presence tied to [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled|The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]**.
**Blind to the Truth:**  
Katherine believes that any problems at Caroline College are purely bureaucratic or financial in nature. She’s convinced that her investigative efforts will uncover corruption, but she has no concept of the supernatural forces manipulating events on campus. Her investigation into **[[Project Caroline]]** has been surface-level, focusing on financial records and outdated military contracts rather than the eldritch experiments that the project was truly built upon. Her resistance to the idea of anything beyond governmental corruption makes her an unwitting obstacle for those trying to uncover the truth.
**Potential Hooks for Investigators:**
- **A Barrier to Progress:** Katherine’s insistence on dismissing pirate broadcasts and rumors about supernatural events could make her an obstacle for investigators. If the investigators attempt to expose the truth about the college’s hidden dangers, they may need to convince Katherine to abandon her idealistic but limited worldview.
- **A Potential Ally:** Despite her blindness to the supernatural, Katherine is highly principled and could become a powerful ally if convinced of the true depth of the corruption. Investigators may need to present her with concrete evidence that her suspicions about the college are just the tip of the iceberg, showing her how her efforts to cover up certain activities are playing into a larger conspiracy.
- **Access to Records:** Katherine’s position as head of the Journalism Department and her interest in archival research give her access to valuable information about the college’s history. Investigators who gain her trust could use this access to uncover hidden details about **Project Caroline** and other dark elements of Watashuka’s past.
**Hobbies and Interests:**
- **Literature and Philosophy:** Katherine spends much of her free time reading literature and philosophical texts, particularly works on ethics and truth. She is a fan of **George Orwell** and **Hannah Arendt**, authors whose works focus on corruption and totalitarianism, though she remains unaware of how her own actions mirror some of the behaviors she critiques.
- **Archival Research:** Katherine enjoys combing through historical records, both for academic purposes and to give her students access to valuable sources. However, she tends to view this research through a narrow lens, focusing on financial and administrative corruption rather than the broader, more dangerous forces at play in Watashuka.
- **Nature Walks:** Katherine often takes long walks in Watashuka’s parks and nearby woodlands, using these moments of solitude to reflect on her work and her students. Though she enjoys the peace of nature, she sometimes feels uneasy when walking alone, as if she’s being watched. She attributes this discomfort to the stress of her job.
**Public Perception:**  
To most of the college’s staff and students, Katherine is a serious but approachable figure, someone who holds herself to high ethical standards and expects the same from those around her. While her attempts to quash the pirate broadcasts have frustrated some of the more rebellious students, her dedication to investigative journalism has earned her respect on campus. However, those who have worked with her closely may notice that her desire to protect the journalism department’s reputation sometimes causes her to overlook uncomfortable truths.

# **Professor Katherine Coates (Head of Journalism at Caroline College, Idealist with Blind Spots)**
- **Role**: Professor Katherine Coates is the head of the _Journalism Department_ at _[Caroline College](Caroline%20College.md)_, where she also serves as the faculty advisor for _The Crier_, the college’s student-run newspaper. A passionate idealist, Katherine believes deeply in the power of journalism to expose corruption and hold institutions accountable. She suspects that some level of governmental corruption is affecting the college, but she remains unaware of the true depth of the government’s activities on campus. She assumes that _[Project Caroline](Project%20Caroline.md)_ ended long ago and dismisses rumors of ongoing secretive experiments or cult involvement as unfounded conspiracy theories. Ironically, by attempting to protect the integrity of the department and her own reputation, she has unknowingly become a part of the problem—often covering up the existence of the pirate radio station broadcasts from _WCTU_ out of embarrassment, further distancing herself from the truth she so desperately seeks.
- **Age**: Mid-30s (1983)
- **Appearance**: Katherine Coates has a distinctive look that matches her intellectual nature. She has short, curly dark hair, wears large round glasses, and often dresses in practical, slightly vintage-style clothing, favoring patterned blouses and cardigans. Her appearance suggests someone deeply engaged in academic life—focused on ideas rather than appearances. Her calm, serious expression reflects her constant state of thought and introspection. She exudes an unassuming air, and while she might seem approachable to students, there’s an underlying intensity to her idealism.
- **Personality**: Katherine is driven by a strong sense of justice and believes in the ethical power of journalism. She pushes her students at _Caroline College_ to investigate stories that expose corruption, inspire change, and give voice to the voiceless. However, her idealism often blinds her to the deeper and more dangerous forces at play in [Watashuka](Watashuka.md). She is particularly frustrated by the _pirate radio broadcasts_ that come out of WCTU, seeing them as a stain on the journalism department's reputation. To maintain her pride, she has begun downplaying or outright denying their existence, not realizing that in doing so, she’s becoming a source of misinformation—exactly what she despises in others. Katherine’s desire to protect her department’s image overrides her instincts, causing her to miss key clues about the strange occurrences happening around campus and the town.
- **Public Role**:
    - **Head of Journalism Department**: Katherine runs the journalism department with an iron focus on ethics and investigation, encouraging her students to dig deep and challenge authority where necessary. Under her guidance, _The Crier_ has earned a reputation for hard-hitting journalism—at least within the confines of campus life. She is proud of the work the students produce and fiercely defends the department’s reputation from internal and external criticism.
    - **Overseeing WCTU**: As the faculty advisor responsible for the campus radio station, Katherine is particularly frustrated by the ongoing pirate radio broadcasts. These underground shows have become a thorn in her side. Katherine has made several attempts to silence the broadcasts, believing them to be nothing more than juvenile acts of rebellion. In her attempts to suppress the problem, however, she inadvertently mirrors the authoritarian tendencies she loathes in corrupt governments, often denying to administrators and others that the pirate broadcasts even exist.
- **Investigating Corruption**: Katherine suspects that something is not right at Caroline College, but her investigations into this suspected corruption remain shallow. She assumes the problems are merely governmental—perhaps related to funding mismanagement or outdated agreements with former military projects. She doesn’t yet understand that the forces she’s up against are far more dangerous and intertwined with occult activities happening under the radar. Her belief that the _Project Caroline_ experiments ended long ago has left her unprepared for the deeper horrors at play.
- **Interaction with Watashuka**:
    - **Interactions with Students**: Katherine is deeply involved in the lives of her students, often acting as a mentor and role model. She encourages them to pursue truth, even when it’s uncomfortable, and her open-door policy makes her popular among those in the journalism department. However, her idealism sometimes causes friction with students who are more interested in sensationalism or entertainment. She sees herself as a protector of the journalistic craft, which can put her at odds with those who view journalism as more of a business or career than a calling.
    - **Tension with [Dave](Dave.md)**: Katherine is very vocal about her disdain for Dave and his pirate broadcasts. She sees him as reckless and irresponsible, a figure who undermines the integrity of the journalism program. This tension has created a somewhat adversarial relationship between her and the [Metalheads](Metalheads.md) community, though she remains unaware of the depth of their involvement in the town’s supernatural struggles.
    - **Covering for WCTU**: In her attempts to protect the department’s image, Katherine has gone as far as to deny the existence of the pirate broadcasts to other college administrators, claiming that any complaints about the broadcasts are baseless. She believes that by quashing the controversy, she is protecting the reputation of the journalism program. This puts her in the uncomfortable position of inadvertently spreading misinformation—a role she would detest if she realized the full extent of her actions.
- **Hobbies and Interests**:
    - **Literature and Philosophy**: Outside of her work at the college, Katherine is an avid reader of both classic literature and philosophical works. She spends much of her free time studying texts on ethics, truth, and justice, often incorporating these ideas into her lectures. She particularly admires figures like _Hannah Arendt_ and _George Orwell_, authors whose works focus on the dangers of corruption and totalitarianism—though she is blind to how some of these critiques may apply to her own behavior.
    - **Archival Research**: Katherine enjoys sifting through historical records and archives, both for personal interest and to find stories for her students. This hobby, however, is more academic than investigative; while she uncovers interesting facts about the town and its history, she doesn’t delve deep enough to see the larger, darker forces at work.
    - **Walking in Nature**: Katherine often takes long walks through Watashuka’s parks and nearby woodlands, enjoying the quiet solitude. These walks allow her to clear her mind and reflect on her work, though she often feels uneasy when alone in the woods—an unexplained discomfort she tends to dismiss as stress.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **Unintentional Obstacle**: Katherine could become an unintentional obstacle to investigators trying to expose the truth about Watashuka’s supernatural undercurrents. Her efforts to cover up pirate broadcasts or downplay student rumors could mislead investigators or slow their progress, as she inadvertently shields the deeper corruption she hasn’t yet uncovered.
    - **A Source of Information**: Once her trust is earned, Katherine could be a valuable ally, especially given her knowledge of journalism, ethics, and corruption. Her access to historical records and her academic connections could help investigators piece together parts of the mystery. However, convincing her of the supernatural truth will be a significant challenge, as she’s resistant to accepting anything outside of rational, governmental corruption.
    - **Potential for Growth**: As events in Watashuka escalate, Katherine’s idealism could either become a strength or lead to her downfall. Investigators might have the chance to push her to open her eyes to the deeper, more sinister forces at play, or they might find themselves working around her if she stubbornly refuses to see beyond her own preconceptions.
- **Public Perception**: Katherine is respected as a dedicated and principled educator, though some find her overly idealistic and occasionally rigid in her views. Her clashes with the _Metalhead_ community and her attempts to silence pirate broadcasts have created a divide between her and the younger, more rebellious students. Despite this, she is seen as a champion of journalistic integrity, someone who holds herself and her students to high ethical standards, even if that means stepping on a few toes in the process.

*In a cluttered office filled with stacks of newspapers and journalism textbooks, a woman is angry; very angry. She sits at her desk, tapping her pencil against a file of student stories. Her short, curly hair bounces slightly as she leans forward to read an article submission more closely. "This needs more depth," she mutters to herself before scribbling notes in the margins. She pushes her glasses up the bridge of her nose and looks out the window. She is fuming. She's going to reject this article for the Crier. She knows it. She also knows its wrong. "Not enough reference material. No interviews. Topic is not worth exploring further." Stacy is a good student and she'll be hurt that her article was rejected for unfair reasons but she'll get over it. She'll rise above it.*
*Coates puts the marked up document in her out box. The title "What Happens On Campus After Midnight?" can be seen sticking out. The professor turns on the campus radio and calms down. "College Chaos". Right show, right time. No interruptions.*

[[Michelina Plum]]
- **Age**: 36 (in 1983)
- **Role**: While Michelina Plum presents a composed and conservative image on the air, her private life tells a different story. Behind the scenes, she leads a secretive, decadent lifestyle filled with alcohol, swinging, and hidden vices that are in stark contrast to her public persona. She graduated from the **University of Wisconsin-Madison** in 1980 and quickly secured her position in [[Watashuka]], where she’s been hiding her more personal secrets ever since. Despite her conservative leanings, her personal life is filled with vices and secrets, which she works hard to keep hidden from the public eye.
- **Disturbing Calls**: Since early **1982**, Michelina has been receiving eerie, anonymous phone calls at **2:15 a.m.** during her broadcasts. The caller speaks in a strange, guttural language that unsettles her deeply. While Michelina initially assumed it was a prank, and assumes that the person was speaking Arabic, the reality is far more sinister—the language is mythos in origin. These calls have left her paranoid and frightened, and despite reporting them to **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]**, no leads have been uncovered.
- **Hidden Connections**:
    - **Captain Bernard Miller**: Michelina is one of the few people in town who knows the truth about **[[Bernard Miller|Captain Bernard Miller]]** and his trips to Milwaukee. She has accompanied him on some of these trips, though whether out of camaraderie or shared secrets remains unclear. Their relationship is built on mutual understanding and the protection of each other’s reputations.
    - **[[Mothers Opposing MetalMothers Opposing Metal (MOM)]]**: Michelina uses her role in **MOM** to reinforce her conservative image, though she has little genuine interest in the group’s moral crusades. Her participation is primarily to distract from her own behavior, helping her maintain her façade while hiding her true lifestyle.
    - [[Dave]]: Her hatred for Dave is so great that she has, jokingly, said she should put a hit on him. It is only jokingly for now, but if escalated, Michelina is not above blackmailing Miller to see that Dave is taken out of the picture.
- **Personality**: Michelina is a master at maintaining her double life. To the public, she is a composed and calming presence, projecting conservative values and a love for order. In private, however, she is deeply conflicted, constantly balancing her public image with her hidden vices. She uses alcohol to cope with the stress of her double life, and while she is highly political, her actions often conflict with the values she preaches.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **The 2:15 A.M. Calls**: Investigators may be drawn into Michelina’s world through the anonymous calls she receives during her broadcasts. These mythos-origin calls could provide a clue to the supernatural forces at play in Watashuka.
    - **Double Life**: Michelina’s hidden lifestyle is filled with secrets that could unravel her public image. Players investigating her background could uncover her connection to **Captain Bernard Miller** or her hidden vices, which may tie into larger town secrets.
    - **MOM Involvement**: As a vocal member of **Mothers Opposing Metal**, Michelina has influence in town, especially among conservative residents. Investigators might use her role in the group to sway public opinion or gain information, though her volatile personality makes her a tricky ally.
- **Public vs. Private**: Michelina is deeply invested in keeping her private life hidden. Any revelations about her double life could destroy her reputation and lead her to drastic actions, making her both a potential ally and a threat to investigators.

# **Michelina Plum**
- **Age**: 36 (in 1983)
- **Role**: Michelina Plum is the sultry host of _Night Vibes_, a late-night radio show on **[[WCTU]]**, Watashuka’s college radio station. Her program, running from **10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.**, features soothing instrumental music and classical tracks aimed at helping her listeners relax during the long, quiet hours of the night. Michelina’s smooth, calming voice has earned her a dedicated following, particularly among students and night-shift workers.
- **Appearance**: Michelina is an attractive woman with striking red hair that falls in loose waves around her shoulders. She has sharp features and bright green eyes that stand out against her glamorous, if somewhat disheveled, appearance. Often dressed in silky, low-cut blouses, she exudes an air of confidence and mystery, especially when she’s behind the microphone. On air, Michelina’s polished, professional persona is in contrast to the sharp, more intense side of her character that only those close to her see.
- **Personality**: On the radio, Michelina is known for her calm, reassuring tone, a voice that seems to ease the worries of her late-night listeners. Off-air, however, she is a different person entirely—witty, foul-mouthed, and with a sharp sense of humor. Michelina is highly political, frequently expressing her admiration for President Reagan and her disdain for the local counterculture. 
- **Public Role**:
    - **WCTU Radio Host**: Michelina is well-known in the community for her late-night radio show, which provides a soothing soundtrack to the town’s quieter hours. She is regarded as an intellectual and a voice of reason, offering a space for Watashuka’s insomniacs, students, and night workers to find comfort in the music she plays.
    - **[[Mothers Opposing Metal-Keeper|Mothers Opposing Metal (MOM)]]**: Michelina is a vocal member of **Mothers Opposing Metal**, a conservative group that fights against the influence of heavy metal music and other perceived corruptions of youth. She frequently speaks out against the local pirate radio DJ, **Dave**, and the **Metalheads**, blaming them for the town’s moral decline.
- **Public Perception**: Most people in [[Watashuka]] see Michelina as a respected, conservative figure who upholds traditional values and provides a calming presence through her radio show. She is known for her intelligence and her involvement in **MOM**, which reinforces her image as a defender of the town’s moral standards. Her sharp political views and vocal support for Reagan resonate with many of the town’s conservative residents, though there are whispers about her hidden wild side from those who know her better.

# **History of [[Watashuka]]**
- **May 1856** – Founding of **Prairieville Academy**
	- **Prairieville Academy** is established as a teacher-training school (normal school) to educate future educators. The academy becomes the heart of the town of Prairieville, which later becomes Watashuka. The academy was the dream of three educators Walter Mann, Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling. There dream was to work with the local Ho-Chunk people to bring forth a new era for the region. That dream is still alive today despite setbacks. 
	- **Founding Members**
		- Walter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy
		- Eleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated
		- John W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated 
		- Elias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen
		- Jonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian
		- Sarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist
- **August 1860** – Destruction of **Prairieville Academy**
	- The academy is destroyed during a violent conflict between the settlers and a rogue native tribe who attacked the school. During the attack many of the educators and founders were killed; only Eleazar Root and John Sterling survived. The academy burned down. Many blame local tensions with indigenous people on the attack. Most records from this time are lost, and it remains a tragic, but poorly understood, event in local history.
- **September 1862** – Rebuilding of **Prairieville School**
	- In the wake of the academy’s destruction, the **Prairieville School** is built to continue the region’s educational mission. Under the leadership of Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling the school thrives and grows as part of the effort to revitalize education in the region, attracting settlers to the area. Eleazar served as the school's first principal while John provided the financial and political support.
- **Blizzard of 1888 - Humanitarian Aid**
	- After the [[Blizzard of 1888]], large numbers of members of the [[Lutheran Church]] immigrate to the region. The first settlers arrive to provide humanitarian assistance but soon took to calling the region home.
- **April 1895** – **Caroline Religious Teaching College** Founded
	- Due to the influence of Lutheran immigrants, the **Caroline Religious Teaching College** is established, expanding the former school into a larger institution focused on religious education. This school subsumed the Prairieville School and most agree that this was more of a renaming than a new school. 
	- At the same time, the town of **Prairieville** is renamed **Watashuka** out of respect of the native peoples. 
		- A minor controversy emerged years later when it was found that name was a wild misinterpreted of the [[Ho-Chunk]] language. The intend was to have the name mean friendship or unity; symbolizing the area's different cultural influences. By the time the mistake was found the name had stuck.
- **1939-1945** – World War II Efforts
	- Caroline Religious Teaching College contributes to the war effort, with local industry and students engaging in patriotic duties. The college’s science and engineering departments grow due to wartime funding. After the war, the college continues expanding its academic programs.
- **1943** – **Caroline College** Renamed
	- The college is officially renamed **[[Caroline College]]** after WWII, reflecting its role as a modern liberal arts institution. The post-war years brought growth and new facilities, including **Sister Sarah’s Medical Center**, a teaching hospital for nursing and healthcare students.
- **1969** – Population Decline
	- Watashuka’s population begins to decline in the late 1960s due to changing economic conditions; notably the closing of several government projects now deemed complete. People start leaving for larger cities like Madison and Milwaukee. The closing of some industries and the general economic downturn are seen as the reasons for this decline.
	- The [[Watashuka Initiative|Watashuka Initiative's]] ending dealt a major blow to the region.
- **1983-Present** – Present Day Watashuka
	- Watashuka is a quiet rural town with Caroline College as its centerpiece. The town struggles economically, but the college brings new students and some level of vibrancy. Residents are largely unaware of any significant issues beyond normal small-town troubles.

# Berg Farm House

*The **Berg Watercolor**, evidence backing up the claim of the Berg Farm House's history.*
## History
Records have been lost regarding the origin of the structure known as the "Berg Farm House", but it undisputedly the oldest surviving building in [[Watashuka]]. This is based on the "Berg Watercolor". The watercolor has been dated to at least 1876 but historian suspect the painting is much older. From the condition of the building in the painting, and the suggestion of community around the farm house via the existence of other structures (long since lost), the farm is assumed to have been built on or around the 1850's or 1860's.
## Current State
![[Berg Farm House - 1978.png]]
 The building, which sits on an overgrown lot on 14<sup>th</sup> street, has survived demolition numerous times in the past decades thanks to the efforts of the Watashuka Historical Society. The rightful owner of the land cannot be determined. The most likely owner, Henry Bergmann, a distant ancestor of the last known Berg family member, claims no ownership. He has actively sought to distance himself, and his family, from the claim. The building is currently abandoned and the Historical Society is attempting to raise funds for renovation and legal work associated with recovering the property.

The **Frozen Cow Burger Stand** is a charming, retro 1950s-style diner with a nostalgic flair, located in the heart of [[Watashuka]]. Run by [[Mike and Ruth Garrison]], the small, rectangular building is painted in bright red and white stripes, with a large neon sign on the roof that proudly displays the stand's quirky name, "Frozen Cow," in bold, glowing letters. The diner has a few chrome-trimmed windows on the front, offering a peek inside where you can see the grill sizzling and the staff bustling.
The exterior is simple but inviting, with a large awning providing shade for a row of vintage-style picnic tables outside, perfect for customers to enjoy their burgers and milkshakes in the open air. The smell of sizzling beef patties, fresh-cut fries, and sweet milkshakes always wafts through the air, drawing people in.
Inside, the décor is a time capsule of mid-century Americana: red vinyl stools line the stainless-steel counter, and the black-and-white checkered floor gives the place an old-school diner feel. The walls are adorned with framed photos of Watashuka from past decades, along with a few posters of classic cars and rock ‘n’ roll icons. A small jukebox sits in the corner, though it’s often drowned out by the sounds of happy customers and sizzling grills.
Despite its small size, the Frozen Cow Burger Stand is always busy, with lines of locals and college students often extending out the door. It’s known for its simple but delicious menu of burgers, fries, and thick milkshakes, all served with a generous side of nostalgia.

[[Peach Street Library]]
The **Peach Street Library** is more than just a quiet repository of books; it is a secret hub of occult knowledge, housing several rare and dangerous texts. Over the years, the library has amassed a collection of tomes connected to eldritch rituals, forbidden knowledge, and dark history, particularly those tied to Watashuka’s unsettling past. Unbeknownst to most visitors, the library’s basement holds a carefully hidden archive of these materials, a collection built up by **[[Sly Coolstein]]**, who is not just the head librarian but also a member of the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]**.
**Sly’s Role:**  
Sly’s involvement in the cult is driven by academic curiosity rather than ambition or malice, and he has spent years collecting these texts for study. Though he does not fully grasp the dangers of what he has compiled, Sly remains fascinated by the occult knowledge contained within the library’s walls. The **Brotherhood** uses Sly and the library as a resource, occasionally retrieving certain books for their rituals. Sly, however, is unaware of the full scope of the cult’s activities and sees himself more as a custodian of arcane knowledge than an active participant in dark deeds.
**Ronnie’s Protection:**  
Though Sly is deeply entrenched in occult matters, he has taken great care to protect his young assistant, **[[Ronnie Regan]]**, from the library's darker secrets. He intentionally keeps her away from the more dangerous texts and hides the existence of the secret archives. Sly views Ronnie as a symbol of purity and innocence, and he fears what might happen if she ever learned the truth about the library’s occult collection. Still, as Ronnie’s curiosity about the occult grows, it becomes harder for Sly to keep her completely in the dark.
**The Hidden Archive:**  
The basement of the Peach Street Library houses a concealed archive of forbidden tomes, grimoires, and scrolls tied to ancient rituals and supernatural forces. These materials have been carefully cataloged and locked away by Sly, who uses them for his research. Though Sly takes precautions to keep this knowledge from the public, certain books have been accessed by members of the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, who use the texts for their own purposes. The archive is a time bomb of potential danger, waiting for the wrong hands to uncover its secrets.
**Potential Hooks for Investigators:**
- **Access to Forbidden Knowledge**: Investigators may discover the hidden archive and realize its connection to the strange happenings in Watashuka. Gaining Sly’s trust could provide access to valuable occult knowledge, but doing so might come with unintended consequences.
- **The Library’s Basement**: Investigators who delve deeper into the Peach Street Library might find the basement’s concealed archive, filled with eldritch lore. However, accessing this area could alert the **Brotherhood**, drawing the attention of dangerous cult members.
- **Sly’s Secrets**: Sly’s involvement with the **Brotherhood** makes him both a potential ally and a dangerous figure. Investigators could exploit his protective instincts toward Ronnie or his obliviousness to the cult’s more sinister activities to manipulate him for information or access to forbidden texts.
**What the Public Doesn’t Know:**  
To most of the town, the Peach Street Library is just a quiet, forgotten institution. However, a select few—especially members of the Brotherhood—are aware of its deeper, darker purpose. While Sly works to protect the town from the more dangerous knowledge hidden within the library, his detachment from reality and lack of understanding about the full consequences of his actions make him an unpredictable and potentially dangerous force in the town’s supernatural landscape.

# Peach Street Library
*On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, the creaky wooden floors of the Peach Street Library echo with the sound of shuffling footsteps. Sly adjusts his thick glasses, squinting as he scans the shelves, seemingly lost in thought. The faint smell of old paper fills the air as Ronnie bounces from stack to stack, eager to organize a new section of books. A patron walks in, the familiar bell above the door jingling softly. "Looking for something in particular?" Sly asks absentmindedly, not looking up from his pile of reference materials. The library may be old and worn, but its charm and peaceful atmosphere are undeniable.*
The **Peach Street Library** is [[Watashuka|Watashuka's]] only public library and has been a quiet cornerstone of the town for decades. Located in an older brick building downtown, the library is a small but cherished institution, offering a modest collection of books ranging from local history to classic literature. Its shelves are packed with aging volumes and dog-eared paperbacks, giving the place a comforting, nostalgic atmosphere. While its resources may not be extensive, the Peach Street Library serves as a peaceful retreat for readers, students, and the occasional researcher looking for information on Watashuka’s history.
The library is run by **[[Sly Coolstein]]**, its head librarian for over thirty years. Despite his often distracted, absent-minded demeanor, Sly knows the library's collection inside and out. He is occasionally assisted by high school student **[[Ronnie Regan]]**, whose enthusiasm for the odd has led to some unusual conversations with patrons from all walks of life. Together, they keep the library running, helping patrons find whatever they need, whether it's a popular novel or a dusty, obscure text.

Beneath the surface of [[The Prince-New & Used Books]], the store holds a darker secret. The shop cat, **Poe**, is not what he seems. Unbeknownst to Dexter Colby, the cat is the immortal spirit of the necromancer Dexter once killed in the Wild West—a being he referred to as a "vampire." While Dexter believes the necromancer is long gone, Poe is in fact biding his time. The necromancer’s essence was bound to the Hound of Tindalos when Dexter shot him, allowing his spirit to take on the form of the black cat.
Poe has been living in this form for decades, quietly watching, waiting, and playing the part of a harmless bookstore pet. Time doesn’t seem to pass for the necromancer while in this form, and he is more than willing to wait as long as it takes for the right moment to rejoin the world in his true form. He watches Dexter with quiet amusement, knowing the man suspects something is off, but Dexter hasn’t figured out the truth yet. The cat plays nice, keeping the illusion of innocence intact, never revealing its true nature. Poe’s patient, immortal nature gives him the advantage—after all, for someone who has already conquered death, waiting is a trivial task.
Though Dexter sometimes catches Poe watching him with an intensity that unnerves him, he brushes it off. He suspects there’s more to Poe than meets the eye, perhaps a remnant of the necromancer’s curse, but he hasn’t yet uncovered the full truth. And so, the two live in an uneasy truce, with Poe lurking in the background, waiting for his time to come. 
Even in his reduced state, Poe still influences those around him by using latent magic to drive customers to books that he wants them to read. This allows him to further his own plans through this influence.

The shop has a timeless charm, from its creaky wooden floors to the large front windows that let in the warm glow of sunlight, making it an inviting spot for visitors to spend hours browsing the shelves.
One of the shop’s most famous residents is **Poe**, the small black cat who can usually be found lounging lazily on the counter or curled up in a sunny window.

Dexter Colby, the current owner, is always ready to recommend a book or help customers find that elusive rare edition.

[[Bernard Miller]]
- **Age**: 44 (in 1983)
- **Role**: Captain Bernard Miller is not only the head of the **[[Watashuka]] Police Department** but also a man hiding a significant secret—his sexual orientation. While publicly presenting himself as a confident womanizer, Bernard is secretly gay. He hides his true nature under the guise of frequent romantic escapades with women, often boasting of trips to Madison when, in reality, he spends his off hours traveling to Milwaukee to immerse himself in the gay bar scene.
- **Secrets**:
    - **Sexual Orientation**: Bernard’s carefully cultivated reputation as a womanizer is a cover to protect his secret. His trips to Milwaukee offer him the rare opportunity to be himself, but he is always cautious about maintaining his cover in Watashuka. The pressure of living a double life weighs heavily on him, and though he is careful, the constant fear of exposure drives much of his behavior, including his reluctance to confront difficult or dangerous situations in the town.
    - **Reluctance Toward Occult Involvement**: Bernard is deeply fearful of the strange occurrences that seem to be increasing in Watashuka. He knows something isn’t right, but his instinct for self-preservation leads him to avoid dealing with these matters directly. He actively suppresses investigations into the occult, knowing that any deep involvement could expose secrets he’s not prepared to face, either about the town or himself.
- **Key Relationships**:
    - **[[Michelina Plum]]**: Bernard’s connection with Michelina, the late-night DJ at **[[WCTU]]**, is one of mutual secrecy. She knows about his trips to Milwaukee and has even accompanied him on occasion. In exchange, Bernard uses his position to keep rumors about Michelina’s private life quiet. Their relationship is fraught with tension, as each holds power over the other’s secret life.
    - **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]**: Bernard’s conflict with Jan stems from Jan’s determination to investigate the strange and unexplained events in Watashuka. Bernard, pressured by town leadership—many of whom have ties to the cults operating in secret—often shuts down Jan’s investigations, labeling them as unsolvable mysteries. This dynamic frustrates Jan and paints Bernard as complicit in the town’s darker secrets, though his motives are more about self-preservation than malice.
- **Attitude Toward Occult Activity**: Bernard knows something is wrong in Watashuka, but he avoids direct involvement out of fear. His strategy is to dismiss the strange happenings as coincidences or to let others handle the investigation while he focuses on keeping his personal life hidden. This makes him a passive figure in the town’s occult landscape, reluctant to take any action that might upset the balance he’s carefully maintained.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **Hidden Allies**: Players who dig into Bernard’s private life might uncover his trips to Milwaukee and his connection to Michelina Plum. Depending on their approach, this could either lead to blackmail or a potential alliance, giving Bernard reason to aid them in exchange for keeping his secret.
    - **Squashing Investigations**: Bernard’s role in suppressing occult investigations can serve as a roadblock for investigators. Players may need to find ways to either work around Bernard’s interference or convince him that helping them is in his best interest, possibly by appealing to his sense of guilt or desire for self-preservation.

# **Captain Bernard Miller**
- **Age**: 44 (in 1983)
- **Role**: Captain Bernard Miller is the head of the **[[Watashuka]] Police Department**, a position that makes him one of the town’s most prominent figures. He is known around Watashuka for his charm and boasts of romantic escapades, often regaling his colleagues and townsfolk with stories of his supposed conquests. However, he maintains a mostly hands-off leadership style, preferring to let his officers handle the day-to-day operations of the department.
- **Appearance**: Bernard is a ruggedly handsome man with a strong build, which gives him an imposing and confident presence. His neatly styled brown hair and clean-shaven face complement his polished look, adding to his overall image of authority. Bernard’s sharp features and athletic frame make him a figure of attention both in uniform and out. His eyes, however, often carry a subtle, distant sadness, a hint of inner conflict beneath his otherwise composed demeanor. Despite his polished exterior, he tends to carry an air of detachment, especially in moments of quiet reflection.
- **Personality**: Outwardly, Bernard presents himself as confident and charming, playing up his reputation as a womanizer to distract from any suspicions about his private life. He’s known for his laid-back approach to his role, which allows him to maintain his comfortable position without making too many waves. Beneath this, Bernard is a man constantly managing inner turmoil, struggling to balance his public image with the pressures of his personal life.
- **Public Role**:
    - **Watashuka Police Department**: As captain of the police force, Bernard is viewed by most as a competent leader, if somewhat distant. He often delegates the bulk of police work to his officers, including more thorough investigations, while he focuses on maintaining order and appearances. His leadership has kept the town functioning smoothly, but his reluctance to confront strange occurrences has led to some tensions within the department, particularly with officers who want to dig deeper into the town’s mysteries.
- **Relationships**:
    - **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]**: While Bernard respects Jan’s investigative skills, he finds Jan’s obsession with the town’s stranger cases frustrating. Bernard’s desire to avoid conflict often leads him to dismiss Jan’s concerns, especially when they veer into the realm of the unexplained. He sees Jan’s persistence as a threat to the delicate balance he maintains with town leadership.
- **Public Perception**: Watashuka views Bernard as a charismatic, if somewhat complacent, police captain. His reputation as a charming womanizer and hands-off leadership style are well-known, and while some view him as disengaged, most of the town is content with his approach, especially as the town has avoided major incidents—at least, so far.

[[Dave]]
- **Name**: Unknown
- **Role**: Dave is more than just a paranoid conspiracy theorist. He’s a key source of cryptic information about the supernatural and occult happenings in Watashuka, though even he doesn’t fully understand what he’s uncovering. His chaotic rants contain hidden truths about the town’s ley lines, secret cults, and Project Caroline. Dave’s pirate broadcasts offer clues to players, though his unreliable narration means they’ll need to sift through the noise to find the valuable details.
- **Theories vs. Truth**: Dave’s erratic monologues blend real occult happenings with his own paranoid imagination. He regularly mentions secret societies, cult meetings, and strange symbols, unknowingly revealing pieces of truth about the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled and other occult forces manipulating the town. His rants about government surveillance often touch on Project Caroline, though he refers to it vaguely and doesn’t fully grasp its purpose. Players can use his broadcasts to gather cryptic clues about the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka, but they’ll need to decode his ramblings to separate fact from fiction.
- **Connection to the Occult**: Dave may not realize it, but his broadcasts are tied to Watashuka’s ley lines, which may explain why his signal is so hard to trace. His show could be inadvertently tapping into the town’s supernatural energy, allowing him to broadcast without being caught. Some speculate that Dave’s sporadic broadcast times and sudden signal cuts are linked to disruptions in the ley lines themselves, though Dave chalks it up to government interference.
- **Rumors About Dave**:    
    - **The Ghost Broadcaster**: Some say Dave died years ago in a car accident, and his spirit now broadcasts from beyond the grave, using old radio frequencies.
    - **An Old Professor**: One theory suggests Dave is a disgruntled former professor from **Caroline College**, possibly one who dabbled in occult studies.
    - **In League with the Cults**: Some residents claim Dave is a cultist himself, using his broadcasts to send coded messages to his followers.
    - **A Rebel Student**: Others believe Dave is a current student, using the college’s equipment to run his show without the administration’s knowledge.
    - **Government Spy**: A few conspiracy theorists think Dave is actually an undercover agent for **Project Caroline**, secretly monitoring the town under the guise of a pirate radio host.
    - **Lives in the Tower**: A rumor persists that Dave broadcasts from **Qubit Tower**, hiding in its unused rooms.
    - **The Forgotten Son**: Some believe Dave is the illegitimate child of a prominent family, using his show to exact revenge on the town.
    - **Amish Defector**: There’s speculation that Dave fled the local Amish community and now rebels against his former life.
    - **A Dark Ritual Survivor**: Some claim Dave was the only survivor of a failed occult ritual in the 1970s and now uses his show to expose the supernatural forces in Watashuka.
- **Mannerisms**: Dave is known for his manic energy, frequently laughing maniacally during his broadcasts. He jumps between topics, blending real-world events with wild conspiracy theories. He is suspicious of everyone, particularly those in positions of power, and constantly warns his listeners to stay vigilant.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **Source of Information**: Dave’s broadcasts provide cryptic clues to players about the supernatural events in Watashuka. However, his chaotic rants mean players must sift through layers of conspiracy theories to uncover valuable details.
    - **Connection to the Occult**: Dave’s sporadic broadcasts and inability to be traced may be linked to the town’s ley lines or Project Caroline. Investigators might use his show to uncover hidden truths about Watashuka’s occult forces.
    - **Rumors and Mysteries**: Dave’s true identity is shrouded in mystery. Players could follow rumors about his origin, discovering he might be more connected to the town’s supernatural history than anyone realizes.
## **Examples of Dave Lines:**
- **Intro:** "Hey, hey, hey, midnight marauders! This is _Metal At Midnight_, comin' at ya live from...well, you don’t need to know where, bro. Let’s just say I’m somewhere those government goons can’t find me, but I know they’re listening. ‘Cause THEY always are, man. But hey, screw ‘em! Let’s get into some Sabbath to start your night right—this one goes out to all the truth-seekers, dude."
- **On Supernatural Events:** "So, check this out, man...there’s been some freaky stuff goin’ down in this town for a long time. Like, way longer than anyone talks about. I’m talkin’ weird symbols, secret meetings at night, and I swear, I saw someone in a black robe hanging out near that creepy old slaughterhouse. They don’t want you to know, but I do. The truth’s out there, man!"
- **Heavy Metal and the Occult:** "You know what gets me, bro? These squares think metalheads are worshiping the devil or whatever. But no way, man! We’re the ones fighting back against the REAL dark stuff. We got the music, we got the guts, and we’re not bowing down to whatever weird cult crap is really goin' on. Up the irons, bro! And now, let’s hear some Maiden!"
- **Paranoia:** "And before you ask, NO, I’m not givin’ out my location, man! 'Cause THEY are out there, waiting. Yeah, that’s right—I see you, you shadowy government spooks, tryin’ to shut me down. But you can’t! Not as long as the metal keeps playin’, man."
- **On the Strange Calls Michelina Gets:** "Oh, and shoutout to that WCTU chick, Michelina—she’s got someone messin’ with her, and I KNOW who it is, but I ain’t sayin’ yet. Just know, she’s in deep, and whoever’s callin’ her? Not from this world, bro. You gotta be careful with that stuff."
## **Ideas for Future Shows:**
### **"Spooky Science? Or Something More Sinister?"**
**What Dave Hears:** The players’ investigation into the biology lab might result in rumors spreading about strange happenings during the lab exercises. Perhaps students gossip about freaky occurrences, unusual sounds, or even the feeling that the classroom was "haunted" during the dissection.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"So, listen up, man...** I got word that some of you little lab rats had a _real_ spooky time in bio class last week. You think that dissection was just frogs and microscopes? Think again, bro. There’s more going on in those biology labs than your teachers are letting on. Strange symbols, weird _feelings_ in the air… Hell, I bet it’s all part of some crazy ritual, man. Yeah, they’re slicing more than frogs in there, bro—keep your eyes peeled for anything that looks _too_ weird. And if you see those symbols? RUN."  
    _(Plays Slayer’s “Angel of Death”)_
---
### **"Where’d the Valley Girl Go?"**
**What Dave Hears:** Rumors about **Amy Mann’s disappearance** spread across campus. Students may have seen her acting suspiciously before vanishing or noticed undercover agents pretending to be campus police poking around her dorm.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Yeah, so check this out…** that valley girl who’s been making the rounds at Caroline College? Word on the street is she’s _gone_—like, _poof_, vanished. Cops showed up, but you know as well as I do that they’re not telling us everything. What was she into? Who was watching her? Could it be… _THEY_? Keep your head on a swivel, kids. It’s always the ones you least expect."  
    _(Plays Iron Maiden’s “Stranger in a Strange Land”)_
---
### **"There’s Something Rotten in Bio Lab!"**
**What Dave Hears:** As players continue to investigate, strange phenomena tied to the failed or ongoing ritual might be reported, such as flickering lights, eerie sensations, or even rumors of supernatural activity. Students might whisper about feeling cold spots or hearing whispers in the bio lab after the players’ first encounter.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Yo, listen up, bro!** Word from the inside says things have been getting real weird in that biology lab. Lights flickering, shadows moving where they shouldn’t be, and a couple of students claiming they heard whispers when no one else was there. I’m telling you, man, something went down there—something big. They’re trying to cover it up, but the truth always gets out, man. So if you’ve got a class in that lab? Watch your back."  
    _(Plays Metallica’s “Creeping Death”)_
---
### **"Class Dissected, Reality Warped"**
**What Dave Hears:** Students gossiping about a failed lab experiment or the freaky occurrences during the ritual’s climax could reach Dave’s ears. His conspiracy-obsessed mind would exaggerate the events, weaving them into a narrative about secret government experiments or occult rituals.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"So get this, man...** word is that some kinda _ritual_ went wrong in the biology lab last week. Yeah, you heard me right—a ritual, bro. And no, it ain’t your regular science experiment. I’m talking _symbols_, _weird lights_, and things _levitating_, dude. You know what that means, right? They’re messing with forces they don’t understand. You feel that chill in the air? That’s not just bad AC, bro—that’s reality tearing at the seams."  
    _(Plays Black Sabbath’s “Into the Void”)_
---
### **"The Vanishing Frog and the Not-So-Innocent Sub"**
**What Dave Hears:** Rumors spread about the strange behavior of the **substitute teacher** leading the biology class. Maybe students noticed their odd jewelry (occult symbols) or overheard cryptic phrases related to the ritual. Dave could latch onto this, suspecting the sub is tied to the cult or the government.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Okay, so like, check this out...** that sub in the bio lab? They’re not who they say they are. I’ve heard rumors that they’re sporting some _real_ freaky jewelry—occult stuff, man. And they’re always muttering weird things under their breath. Yeah, I know—it sounds nuts, but I’m telling you, THEY are hiding something. They’re in on the ritual stuff, bro. And the way they were running that lab class? Totally sus. Watch out for them—they’re more than just a teacher."  
    _(Plays Judas Priest’s “Breaking the Law”)_
---
### **"Amy’s Ghost? Or Something Worse?"**
**What Dave Hears:** After Amy Mann’s disappearance, rumors of sightings or eerie phenomena around campus—possibly tied to her undercover work or the supernatural—might start to circulate. People might claim to have seen Amy’s figure at night, but her behavior seems off.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Yo, this is a wild one...** some folks are saying they’ve _seen_ that valley girl walking around at night, but she’s not _acting_ like herself, man. Like, spooky stuff—shadows flickering, people hearing her voice when she’s not around. Is it a ghost? A doppelgänger? Or maybe she’s got caught up in something way worse. Either way, bro, keep your eyes peeled. If you see her, don’t get too close."  
    _(Plays Ozzy Osbourne’s “Bark at the Moon”)_
---
### **"The Bio Lab Conspiracy"**
**What Dave Hears:** Students might talk about the weird energy or lingering effects after the ritual’s failure (or success). The idea that the biology lab is "haunted" or cursed could spread through campus, and Dave would latch onto this, weaving it into his conspiracy theories.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"So, there’s this buzz goin' around...** the bio lab’s been off ever since that thing went down last week. People are saying the room’s _haunted_ or cursed. Like, bro, I’m telling you, it’s not just your usual science mishap. They’ve got _rituals_ going on in there, and whatever they were summoning? It’s left a mark. The walls remember, man. The lights flicker for a reason. That room ain’t safe anymore."  
    _(Plays Iron Maiden’s “Fear of the Dark”)_
---
### **"Cover-Up at Caroline!"**
**What Dave Hears:** If the players uncovered some evidence of a connection between the **biology lab** and the cult (or even Project Caroline), Dave might get wind of the university or local authorities trying to cover it up. His broadcast would reflect his growing paranoia about hidden forces at work.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"You think the school’s lookin’ out for you? Wrong, bro.** Word on the street is they’re _covering up_ whatever went down in that lab. And the local cops? Yeah, they’re in on it too. The truth is, this goes way deeper than some missing valley girl or a botched dissection. We’re talkin’ full-blown _conspiracy_ to hide whatever the hell they were trying to summon. Keep digging, and maybe you’ll find the real truth. Just don’t let THEM find you first."  
    _(Plays Megadeth’s “Hangar 18”)_
### **The Nighttime "Dumpster Operation"**
**What Dave Hears:** Someone may witness or overhear players sneaking into **Sister Sarah’s Medical Center** or spot strange activity near the hospital. They might hear rumors of unusual late-night trash collection or strange behavior around the dumpsters, especially if the players disturb or investigate the area during their adventure.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Dumpster Divers, Dude!** I heard from my ‘sources’—yeah, you heard me right, sources—that some of you metalheads have been snoopin’ around Sister Sarah’s. I’m tellin’ ya, it’s no joke. Weird stuff’s goin' on after midnight, and I KNOW they’re throwin’ away more than used bandages. Trash gets picked up late at night, and it’s not your average garbage, man. I’ve seen the shadows move... too clean for comfort! Maybe they’re takin’ out more than trash. You’re brave, but don’t get too close, or you’ll end up on their hit list."  
    _(Metallica’s “Disposable Heroes” fades in for dramatic effect)_

### **Bizarre Hospital Sightings**
**What Dave Hears:** Someone hears that the players encountered something disturbing or supernatural inside the hospital—whether it’s **shadowy figures**, **inexplicable screams**, or evidence of experiments. The players might spread rumors or slip details to a local, which eventually reaches Dave.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"The Bleach-Clean Hellhouse!"** "So, I hear some of you’ve gotten brave and checked out ol’ Sister Sarah’s at night. The things you saw, huh? Shadows that move weird, patients that ain’t exactly... _alive_ anymore? Some of you vets know what I’m talkin’ about—screams in the night, bodies moved in and out faster than you can say 'medical malpractice.' You ever wonder what’s really happenin’ back there? Well, wonder no more, man—it’s like a sci-fi slasher flick, but you’re IN IT. Just be careful, ‘cause THEY don’t want anyone talkin’."  
    _(Plays Black Sabbath’s “Into the Void” as the music break)_

### **Missing Staff or Patients**
**What Dave Hears:** Someone in town starts gossiping about missing hospital staff or patients after the players’ investigation. Maybe the players rescued someone, or they uncovered something that led to hospital staff disappearing or being relocated by the cult. The community may notice staff turnover or unexplained absences.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Vanishing Acts at Sarah’s!"** "You ever notice how people just... disappear? Yeah, like staff at Sister Sarah’s, man. Heard from a reliable source that some of the nurses and docs there just up and vanished. Or maybe it’s the patients? Hard to keep track. One minute they’re there, next minute—_poof!_—gone. It’s like magic, bro, except darker and creepier. You think they just quit? Nah, THEY know something we don’t. I bet they’re cleaning up their mess, and trust me, it ain’t bandages and bedpans they’re throwin’ out."  
    _(Plays Judas Priest’s “Beyond the Realms of Death”)_
---
### **Increased Security at Sister Sarah’s**
**What Dave Hears:** After the players' investigation, security might increase at **Sister Sarah’s Medical Center**. Whether it’s more guards, stricter visitor rules, or rumors of the hospital becoming more secretive, locals might talk about how it’s harder to get in or how the staff seems more on edge.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Watch Your Back at Sarah’s!"** "Heard from one of my night owls that security at Sarah’s has ramped up big time. Yeah, you didn’t hear it from me, but they don’t want anyone else pokin' around. Something big went down there recently—don’t ask me how I know, ‘cause I ain’t sayin'. But if you think you’re gonna stroll in there for some late-night adventure, think again. They’re on high alert, man. Something’s got ‘em scared, and I bet you ten bucks it ain’t just the bedbugs."  
    _(Plays Megadeth’s “Wake Up Dead”)_
---
### **Prairie Hall and the Hospital Connection**
**What Dave Hears:** If the players investigated both **Prairie Hall** and **Sister Sarah’s**, they might have discovered links between the two locations—possibly involving records, financial transactions, or even cult connections. Word of this investigation could trickle back to Dave, who’ll speculate wildly about the connections.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Museum of Horrors and Hospital of Doom!"** "I’ve been tellin' you guys for ages—**Prairie Hall** and **Sister Sarah’s** are connected. Don’t believe me? Just think about it. Who keeps old medical records? The ones they don’t want you to see? And where do they send the ones who know too much? _Bingo._ Prairie Hall ain’t just some dusty old museum—it’s where they keep the skeletons in the closet, bro! And those skeletons are real! Next time you’re around there, look at the shadows—they might look back."  
    _(Plays Dio’s “Holy Diver”)_
---
### **The Players' Actions Leak into Dave’s Rant**
**What Dave Hears:** Someone recognizes the players as the ones sneaking around **Sister Sarah’s** or **Prairie Hall** and talks about their activities, leading Dave to speculate about who they are and what they’re after.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Somebody’s Lookin’ for Trouble!"** "Hey, man, someone’s been diggin' around where they don’t belong. I ain’t namin' names, but you know who you are. I respect the hustle, dude—you wanna know the truth, just like me. But be careful. They’ve got eyes everywhere, and I bet you’re on their radar now. Hell, maybe you’ve seen something you shouldn’t. Just don’t come cryin' to ol' Dave when THEY start knockin' on your door at 3 AM. Keep your head down, metal militia!"  
    _(Plays Iron Maiden’s “Run to the Hills”)_
---
### **A Follow-Up Investigation**
**What Dave Hears:** Rumors spread that people (possibly even the players) have gone back to **Sister Sarah’s** or **Prairie Hall** for a second round of investigations. Dave, ever the conspiracy theorist, seizes on the idea that they must have found something important the first time and are digging deeper.
**Dave’s Broadcast:**
- **"Round Two at Sarah’s!"** "Heard through the grapevine that some brave souls—or maybe just plain crazy—have gone back to Sister Sarah’s or that creepy museum. You know what that means, man—they’re onto something. You don’t go back unless you found something worth the risk. So what did you see, huh? I bet it’s something THEY don’t want getting out. You better be careful, ‘cause next time might be the last time you go in. But hey, if you find out something juicy, drop a tip to ol' Dave—I’m all ears!"  
    _(Plays Slayer’s “Raining Blood”)_

![[Dave.png]]
# **Dave**
- **Name**: Unknown (only referred to as "Dave")
- **Age**: Unknown
- **Role**: Dave is the enigmatic, and elusive, pirate radio host of the underground show _Metal At Midnight_. He hijacks **[[WCTU]]**, [[Caroline College|Caroline College's]] AM radio station, for sporadic, late-night broadcasts that combine heavy metal music with wild, conspiracy-laden rants about the government, secret societies, cults, and the supernatural forces lurking in Watashuka. The show starts at exactly midnight and runs until it is abruptly cut off, never airing past **6:14 a.m.** Despite multiple attempts by the college and local authorities to trace his signal, no one has successfully uncovered Dave's identity or location.    
- **Personality**: Dave is a charismatic and chaotic presence on the airwaves, blending metal anthems with conspiracy theories. His rants are erratic and filled with stoner slang like "bro," "man," and "dude." He jumps between topics with manic energy, often weaving real-world issues with his paranoid theories about government surveillance, cult activity, and the occult. Dave frequently laughs maniacally during his broadcasts and mocks those in positions of power, particularly conservative figures like **[[Mothers Opposing Metal-Keeper|Mothers Opposing Metal|MOM]]** and the local police.    
- **Beliefs**: Dave believes shadowy forces are tracking him, particularly the government and various secret societies. He sees himself as a voice for the oppressed, fighting back against the powers that be by spreading the truth through heavy metal music. He regularly mocks the satanic panic of the era, claiming that the real evil is something far worse, hiding in plain sight within Watashuka.    
- **Appearance**: No one knows what Dave looks like. His identity remains a mystery to the authorities, students, and his listeners. Rumors swirl about who Dave might be—some believe he’s a former student or professor, others think he’s an outsider who’s taken up residence on the outskirts of town.    
- **Public Role**:    
    - **Pirate Radio Host**: Dave’s show, _Metal At Midnight_, has a devoted following among the town’s [[Metalheads]] and outcasts. His broadcasts encourage rebellion and defiance against Watashuka’s conservative forces, particularly **[[Mothers Opposing Metal]]**. Through his rants, Dave inadvertently reveals pieces of truth about the town’s occult activity, though listeners must wade through his chaotic monologues to find useful information.
    - **Counterculture Symbol**: To many of Watashuka’s younger, more rebellious residents, Dave is a symbol of defiance against the town’s conservative establishment. His show has become a rallying point for the town’s metalheads, who see him as a voice speaking out against the hypocrisy and hidden darkness of the town.
- **Public Perception**: To most of the town, Dave is nothing more than a nuisance, a conspiracy-theorist pirate radio host whose broadcasts are both hard to find and hard to take seriously. While his rants seem like wild paranoia, some of Watashuka’s youth have come to idolize him as a champion of their anti-establishment mindset. Most adults, particularly those in positions of authority, view him as a disruptive force, but they can’t seem to track him down.
- **Rumors About Dave**:    
    - **The Ghost Broadcaster**: Some say Dave died years ago in a car accident, and his spirit now broadcasts from beyond the grave, using old radio frequencies.
    - **An Old Professor**: One theory suggests Dave is a disgruntled former professor from [[Caroline College]], possibly one who dabbled in occult studies.
    - **In League with the Occult**: Some residents claim Dave is a Satanist himself, using his broadcasts to send coded messages to his followers.
    - **A Rebel Student**: Others believe Dave is a current student, using the college’s equipment to run his show without the administration’s knowledge.
    - **Government Spy**: A few conspiracy theorists think Dave is actually an undercover agent for the secret [[Watashuka Initiative|Project Caroline]], secretly monitoring the town under the guise of a pirate radio host.
    - **Lives in the Tower**: A rumor persists that Dave broadcasts from **Qubit Tower**, hiding in its unused rooms.
    - **The Forgotten Son**: Some believe Dave is the illegitimate child of a prominent family, using his show to exact revenge on the town.
    - **Amish Defector**: There’s speculation that Dave fled the local [[Amish]] community and now rebels against his former life.
    - **A Dark Ritual Survivor**: Some claim Dave was the only survivor of a failed occult ritual in the 1970s and now uses his show to expose the supernatural forces in [[Watashuka]].
    - **A Ho-Chunk Teacher**: A rumor that Dave is a member of the [[Ho-Chunk]] people who is trying to share secret knowledge.

[[Dexter Colby]]
Dexter Colby has lived in Watashuka since the 1880s, hiding from a relentless **Hound of Tindalos**. Originally from England, Dexter fled to the American West in the mid-19th century, where he encountered a powerful necromancer (who Dexter believes was a vampire). After killing the mage, Dexter was cursed, setting the Hound on his trail. Only the town's strange occult protections, including the influence of the [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Amish]] rituals, have kept the Hound from reaching him. Dexter has lived in perpetual fear, unable to leave [[Watashuka|Watashuka’s]] borders, and while he outwardly appears calm and collected, he remains constantly vigilant.
Dexter avoids [[Caroline College]], where the occult experiments of the [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]] have weakened the protective barrier that keeps the Hound at bay. He has developed a strong aversion to the campus and subtly steers customers away from discussions that might lead to questions about the school. Despite his fears, Dexter maintains his cover as a mild-mannered bookseller, passing himself off as the latest in a long line of Colbys who have run the store for generations. He carefully cultivates relationships that keep his past from being questioned and avoids photography or long-term acquaintances who might notice his lack of aging.
## Keeping The Truth Hidden
### Hiding His Age
Dexter Colby, having lived in Watashuka since the 1880s, would need to be particularly clever and meticulous in maintaining his cover. Over the decades, he has likely employed a number of subtle strategies and crafted convincing stories to prevent suspicion. Here are some methods Dexter might use to keep his true identity hidden from the town's residents:
- **Frequent Name Changes (Within the Family Line)**
	- Dexter cycles through different variations of his name, claiming to be different generations of the "Colby" family. Every few decades, he might introduce himself as "Dexter Colby Jr." or "D. Colby," telling the town that the bookstore has been passed down from father to son. He regularly updates the store's business license and paperwork to reflect these generational changes.
	- **Story:** "My father started this bookstore, and now I'm keeping the family tradition alive."
- **"Out-of-Town" Trips**
	- Dexter occasionally claims to travel for long stretches of time to visit family or pursue rare book acquisitions. During these absences (which could range from several weeks to even a year), people don’t notice the passage of time as much. He might return with tales of far-off places, lending to his mystique while providing an excuse for any perceived changes in appearance or behavior.
	- **Story:** "I've just returned from Europe, hunting down rare first editions for the shop. It's good to be back."
- **Low Profile and Private Life**
	- Dexter purposefully avoids being the center of attention. He doesn’t attend community events, weddings, or funerals regularly, and when he does, he blends in and leaves quickly. By not becoming deeply involved in personal relationships, most people see him as a slightly reclusive bookworm, which suits his low-key lifestyle.
	- **Story:** "I prefer to keep to myself—books are my real friends."
- **Claiming to Age Slowly (Family Trait)**
	- Dexter can explain his youthful appearance as part of a long-lived family, where members tend to age more slowly than others. He downplays any concerns about his lack of visible aging by referencing distant relatives who also lived into their 90s while looking younger than their years.
	- **Story:** "My family has always been blessed with good genes. I guess I’m lucky to take after my grandmother—she still looked 50 at 80."
- **Strategic "Retirement" and "Reopening"**
	- Every few decades, Dexter might "retire" briefly, closing the shop or handing it off to a fictional family member. During these periods, he rebrands himself slightly and then reopens the store under the guise of a new "generation" of Colbys. Any residents who question this shift are told that the "new" Dexter is simply a younger relative.
	- **Story:** "I’m the nephew of the original Dexter. I’ve inherited the store after my uncle’s retirement."
- **Sparse Historical Record**
	- Dexter is cautious about keeping minimal public records, avoiding excessive paperwork or social engagements that could leave too much evidence. He might pay in cash, avoid the use of modern banking systems, and steer clear of situations that could tie him to past eras.
	- **Story:** "I prefer to keep things simple—no need for too much bureaucracy in running a small shop."
- **Limiting Photographs and Public Appearances**
	- Dexter subtly avoids being photographed or attending public events where photographs might be taken. He’s been known to "not look right in pictures" and has a knack for subtly dodging photos, making sure there’s little visual evidence of his presence over the years.
	- **Story:** "I’ve never been one for photos—I’m not very photogenic, and I feel out of place in them."
- **Friends in the Right Places**
	- Over the years, Dexter has befriended certain individuals who may unknowingly help shield him from suspicion. These could be local officials, clerks, or even older residents who simply vouch for him as an upstanding, long-term resident. By fostering goodwill with select town members, Dexter creates a network of people who never question his longevity.
	- **Story:** "Old Mr. So-and-So always spoke highly of the Colby family—he knew them better than anyone."
- **Fostering Misinformation**
	- Occasionally, Dexter might encourage rumors about his family or store that explain any oddities. For instance, some residents might think he had a reclusive brother or uncle who ran the shop during times when Dexter disappeared. Over time, these rumors become part of the town’s lore, helping mask any inconsistencies in his story.
	- **Story (spread by town gossip):** "Did you hear? I think it was Dexter’s uncle who was in charge of the store back in the 1920s. They’ve always kept the business in the family."
- **Claiming Ancestral Ties to the Town**
	- Dexter often refers to old photographs or documents (which he could easily forge or acquire) to establish a history of his family in Watashuka. The town might have a rich history, but Dexter has been careful to claim that his family has been tied to the town’s growth, making it believable that the Colby lineage has been around for generations.
	- **Story:** "The Colbys have been here since the town was Prairieville Academy. We’ve always been part of Watashuka’s history."
### Example Deflections
Here are some example conversations where **Dexter Colby** deflects or sidesteps questions about his past, while maintaining his cover as the unassuming owner of _The Prince: New & Used Books_:
- **Customer**: "Dexter, how old _are_ you, really? You don’t seem to age!" 
	- **Dexter**: _chuckles_ "Oh, you know, good genes and a quiet life surrounded by books can work wonders. My family’s always looked younger than our years. Just lucky, I suppose."
- **Customer**: "So, how long has your family owned this bookstore? Since the 1800s, right?" 
	- **Dexter**: "Yes, quite a while. My great-grandfather opened the shop. I’m just carrying on the family tradition, you know? The Colbys have always been fond of literature."
- **Curious Student**: "I swear, there’s an old photo of a man who looks exactly like you hanging in the library. Is that your ancestor?" 
	- **Dexter**: _smiles_ "We Colbys do have a family resemblance that runs strong. That’s probably my great-uncle, or someone from a few generations back. Funny how history repeats itself, isn’t it?"
- **Customer**: "You’ve been here as long as I can remember, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen you take a vacation. Don’t you get tired of running the shop?" 
	- **Dexter**: "Oh, I take little trips now and then. Europe, mostly, for rare book acquisitions. I guess I just keep a low profile while I’m away. The bookstore keeps me grounded."
- **Newcomer**: "Wow, this place feels like a time capsule. How do you manage to keep everything so... untouched?" 
	- **Dexter**: "Well, when you’ve been in business for as long as we have, you learn to respect tradition. Besides, old things have a charm that new things can’t quite replicate, don’t you think?"
- **Old Friend**: "Dexter, I’ve known you for 30 years, and you haven’t changed a bit! What’s your secret?" 
	- **Dexter**: _laughs_ "Oh, please, I’ve got more gray hairs than I care to admit. You’ve probably just got a better memory than I do."
- **Customer**: "I was talking to Mr. Habersham, and he mentioned he knew your father? Isn’t that a bit... odd? Habersham’s been around forever." 
	- **Dexter**: "Oh yes, Norm was quite good friends with my father. I guess I take after him—quiet and reserved. He loved this bookstore just as much as I do."
- **Curious Resident**: "There’s a rumor you’ve been running this shop for over a century, Dexter. Any truth to that?" 
	- **Dexter**: _smiles politely_ "I wish! No, the shop’s been in the family for a long time, but it’s been passed down. We Colbys have a tendency to stick around Watashuka."
- **Customer**: "How do you know so much about local history? You talk like you were actually there." 
	- **Dexter**: "I’ve read just about every book on Watashuka’s past. You can learn quite a bit if you spend enough time with your nose in the right pages."
- **Student**: "Have you ever thought about teaching at Caroline College? With your knowledge, you’d make a great professor!" 
	- **Dexter**: "Ah, I’m flattered, but the academic world’s a bit too... complicated for me. I prefer the quiet life here, surrounded by good books and good company."
### Created Family Tree
- **Edward Colby** (born 1820s, died 1882)
    - **Relationship**: Dexter's supposed great-grandfather, the "founder" of _The Prince: New & Used Books_.
    - **Story**: Edward Colby is the original owner who migrated to Watashuka from England in the mid-1800s, bringing with him a passion for books and literature. He is said to have opened the bookstore in the 1880s. Dexter would claim to have never met Edward but knows family stories of his great-grandfather’s strict but wise demeanor. This is the name of Dexter's actual father. 
    - **Key Lie**: "Edward Colby’s dedication to the written word is what started the store, and I’m proud to carry on his legacy."
- **Jonathan Colby** (born 1850s, died 1923)    
    - **Relationship**: Dexter’s supposed grandfather.
    - **Story**: Jonathan Colby, the second-generation owner, took over the shop from his father in the late 19th century. Jonathan expanded the business, sourcing rare books from all over the country. He’s described as a quiet man with a love for historical texts, much like Dexter himself. He passed away in the 1920s, which would align with Dexter’s "current" persona being the third generation of Colbys.
    - **Key Lie**: "My grandfather Jonathan always had a keen eye for rare books—he's the one who turned _The Prince_ into a true collector's paradise."
- **Thomas Colby** (born 1880s, died 1954)    
    - **Relationship**: Dexter’s supposed father.
    - **Story**: Thomas Colby, the third-generation owner, took over from Jonathan after World War I. Thomas was known to be more outgoing and social than his predecessors, frequently attending local events and donating to the library. Thomas supposedly ran the bookstore through the Great Depression and World War II, though Dexter will often downplay his father’s involvement, claiming that "running a bookstore was much simpler back then."
    - **Key Lie**: "My father, Thomas, was a people person—he loved this town and always kept the store thriving, even during the tough times."
- **Dexter Colby Sr.** (born 1910s, "died" 1975)    
    - **Relationship**: Dexter’s supposed uncle or father, depending on what generation Dexter claims to be in at the time.
    - **Story**: Dexter can claim to be the son of this Dexter Colby Sr., who ran the store through the mid-20th century. Dexter Sr. was a private man, described as somewhat reclusive, though known for his love of British literature. He supposedly passed away in the early 1980s, conveniently when the "current" Dexter Colby took over the shop.
    - **Key Lie**: "Dexter Sr. was a quiet man, kept mostly to himself. I’m named after him, though I’ve tried to be a bit more involved in the community."
- **Dexter Colby** (born 1950s, currently alive)
    - **Relationship**: This is the current "Dexter" that townspeople interact with—the fourth generation of Colbys to run _The Prince: New & Used Books_.
    - **Story**: The current Dexter, named after his father/uncle, took over the store in the 1980s after Dexter Sr. passed away. He claims to be carrying on the family legacy with pride, and while he maintains a quiet demeanor, he’s known for his vast knowledge of literature, much like the Colbys before him.
### Strategy for Covering the Timeline:
- **Death Dates**: Dexter Colby ensures that each "generation" has a clear beginning and end, with deaths or retirements happening conveniently at the start of new decades. This provides a buffer if anyone looks into records but avoids specific dates to reduce risk of scrutiny.
- **Personality Variations**: Dexter can attribute slight personality changes between generations to explain why he is different from his supposed father or grandfather (e.g., one was a recluse, another a socialite).
- **Historical Context**: Dexter weaves in real historical events to keep the stories believable—mentioning the Great Depression or World Wars when discussing the hardships or success of previous Colbys.
- **"Out-of-Town" Trips**: Dexter occasionally claims to travel for long stretches of time to visit family or pursue rare book acquisitions. During these absences (which could range from several weeks to even a year), people don’t notice the passage of time as much. He might return with tales of far-off places, lending to his mystique while providing an excuse for any perceived changes in appearance or behavior. **Story:** "I've just returned from Europe, hunting down rare first editions for the shop. It's good to be back."
- **Low Profile and Private Life**: Dexter purposefully avoids being the center of attention. He doesn’t attend community events, weddings, or funerals regularly, and when he does, he blends in and leaves quickly. By not becoming deeply involved in personal relationships, most people see him as a slightly reclusive bookworm, which suits his low-key lifestyle. **Story:** "I prefer to keep to myself—books are my real friends."
- **Claiming to Age Slowly (Family Trait)**: Dexter can explain his youthful appearance as part of a long-lived family, where members tend to age more slowly than others. He downplays any concerns about his lack of visible aging by referencing distant relatives who also lived into their 90s while looking younger than their years. **Story:** "My family has always been blessed with good genes. I guess I’m lucky to take after my grandmother—she still looked 50 at 80."
- **Strategic "Retirement" and "Reopening"** Every few decades, Dexter might "retire" briefly, closing the shop or handing it off to a fictional family member. During these periods, he rebrands himself slightly and then reopens the store under the guise of a new "generation" of Colbys. Any residents who question this shift are told that the "new" Dexter is simply a younger relative. **Story:** "I’m the nephew of the original Dexter. I’ve inherited the store after my uncle’s retirement."
- **Sparse Historical Record** Dexter is cautious about keeping minimal public records, avoiding excessive paperwork or social engagements that could leave too much evidence. He might pay in cash, avoid the use of modern banking systems, and steer clear of situations that could tie him to past eras. He is also not opposed to reverting to his old gunfighter life to take a less than honest option to destroy records. **Story:** "I prefer to keep things simple—no need for too much bureaucracy in running a small shop."
- **Limiting Photographs and Public Appearances** Dexter subtly avoids being photographed or attending public events where photographs might be taken. He’s been known to "not look right in pictures" and has a knack for subtly dodging photos, making sure there’s little visual evidence of his presence over the years. **Story:** "I’ve never been one for photos—I’m not very photogenic, and I feel out of place in them."
- **Friends in the Right Places** Over the years, Dexter has befriended certain individuals who may unknowingly help shield him from suspicion. These could be local officials, clerks, or even older residents who simply vouch for him as an upstanding, long-term resident. By fostering goodwill with select town members, Dexter creates a network of people who never question his longevity. **Story:** "Old Mr. So-and-So always spoke highly of the Colby family—he knew them better than anyone."

For instance, some residents might think he had a reclusive brother or uncle who ran the shop during times when Dexter disappeared. Over time, these rumors become part of the town’s lore, helping mask any inconsistencies in his story. **Story (spread by town gossip):** "Did you hear? I think it was Dexter’s uncle who was in charge of the store back in the 1920s. They’ve always kept the business in the family."
- **Claiming Ancestral Ties to the Town** Dexter often refers to old photographs or documents (which he could easily forge or acquire) to establish a history of his family in Watashuka. The town might have a rich history, but Dexter has been careful to claim that his family has been tied to the town’s growth, making it believable that the Colby lineage has been around for generations. **Story:** "The Colbys have been here since the town was Prairieville Academy. We’ve always been part of Watashuka’s history."
### Example Dialogue to Maintain Consistency:
- **"Oh, that would’ve been my grandfather, Jonathan. He was the one who started collecting rare books. I just wish I’d been around to meet him."**
- **"The Colbys have always been in Watashuka. We’ve seen the town change so much since my great-grandfather opened the shop in the 1880s."**
- **"My father—Thomas Colby—ran this place through the 30s and 40s. I’m lucky he left me such a strong foundation."**

# Dexter Colby
*The bell above the door jingles as a customer steps into The Prince. Dexter, with his salt-and-pepper hair neatly combed, looks up from the old novel he’s been reading, offering a subtle smile. "Looking for something in particular?" he asks in his calm, deep voice. He moves gracefully around the shelves, his fingers brushing the spines of books that seem older than the building itself. Dexter may not be the most outgoing shopkeeper, but there’s something about him that makes his quiet bookstore feel like a timeless haven.*
Dexter Colby is the owner of [[The Prince-New & Used Books|The Prince: New & Used Books]], a charming, slightly dusty bookstore filled with an eclectic selection of literature.

Secrets for [[Jan Ducochik]]
- **Role**: Since joining the police force in **1980**, Jan has become increasingly aware of supernatural events happening in [[Watashuka]]. He believes dark forces are manipulating the town and is secretly investigating these occurrences. He is highly suspicious of his colleagues, fearing many are involved in occult activities. He works closely with [[Norm Habersham]], investigating behind the scenes to expose occult influences and uncover hidden truths.
- **Suspicion of Captain Bernard Miller**: Jan is particularly wary of his superior, **Captain Bernard Miller**, suspecting the captain of occult involvement due to frequent absences and an apparent lack of interest in investigating strange events. However, Jan has misread Miller’s secret trips to Milwaukee, which are tied to Miller's hidden personal life rather than supernatural activities. This misinterpretation heightens Jan’s paranoia, fueling tension between them.
- **Religious Conviction**: Though outwardly respectful of the town’s Lutheran traditions, Jan believes his Catholic faith is superior. He views the [[Lutheran Church]] as spiritually weak and lacking depth but keeps these feelings carefully concealed, only allowing his true thoughts to surface in moments of extreme stress. This internal conflict adds to his sense of isolation, particularly as his investigations grow more dangerous.
- **Investigator of the Unexplained**: Jan has compiled a secret file documenting bizarre events in Watashuka—disappearances, strange symbols, and mysterious deaths—and quietly investigates them, convinced the town is hiding something dark. His growing paranoia makes him distrustful, even of those closest to him, which complicates his work. However, his drive to protect Watashuka keeps him dedicated to uncovering the truth.

# Leonid "Lenny" Kuznetsov
**Role/Title:** Night Stock Boy at Dominick's Grocery, Unwilling Recruit of the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]**
**Description:** Lenny Kuznetsov, known as "Lenny," is an 18-year-old high school dropout who works the night shift at Dominick’s Grocery. With greasy black hair, a sallow complexion, and a perpetual scowl, Lenny exudes anger and resentment, traits that have made him easy prey for the cult. Raised by an abusive father and abandoned by his mother, Lenny has learned to trust no one and uses violence to assert what little control he feels he has in life.
**Background:** Lenny was born into a Russian immigrant family and had a difficult upbringing. His mother left when he was young, and his father’s physical abuse turned Lenny into a bitter and angry young man. He dropped out of school to work, becoming isolated from his peers and finding solace in violent tendencies. It was during his job at Dominick’s that he met Randolph Tomaszewski, who recognized Lenny’s potential for manipulation and brought him into the **Church of the Delayed Blossom**.
**Cult Role:** Lenny was recruited by [[Randolph Tomaszewski-Keeper]], who used Lenny’s rage and desperation to his advantage, making him a loyal, if reluctant, pawn of the Church. While Lenny is not fully aware of the cult’s true nature or goals, he has been drawn into their orbit, believing that by serving them he will eventually gain the power and respect he craves. Lenny resents Randolph’s control over him but also fears what might happen if he defies him. His fear of both Randolph and the cult keeps him obedient, but he harbors dreams of breaking free.
**Goals:**
- **Power and Respect**: Lenny’s primary goal is to gain power within [[Watashuka]], eventually freeing himself from Randolph’s control and establishing himself as someone others fear and respect.
- **Break Free from Randolph**: Lenny’s resentment toward Randolph is growing, and though he continues to serve him for now, he secretly hopes to find a way to break free of the cult’s influence.
- **Win Over Ronnie Regan**: Lenny harbors an unhealthy crush on [[Ronnie Regan]], the young assistant at Peach Street Library. Though Ronnie is unaware of his feelings, Lenny has been secretly stalking her. He is torn between wanting to impress her and his darker urges, making him a volatile and dangerous presence in her life.
**Personality:**
- **Aggressive and Violent**: Lenny’s first instinct is always to resort to violence, especially when he feels threatened or belittled.
- **Manipulative**: Though not particularly intelligent, Lenny has learned how to use intimidation and manipulation to get what he wants from others, especially those he sees as weaker.
- **Resentful and Selfish**: Lenny resents anyone who has what he doesn’t—whether that’s authority, power, or control. He has little regard for others’ well-being, prioritizing his own needs and desires.
**Relationships:**
- **[[Randolph Tomaszewski]]**: Lenny serves Randolph grudgingly, acting as an apprentice and enforcer for the cult. Though he follows Randolph’s orders, Lenny resents the control Randolph has over him and dreams of the day he can exact revenge on both Randolph and the cult.
- **[[Ronnie Regan|Ronnie "Moonglow" Regan]]**: Lenny’s obsession with Ronnie is unhealthy and dangerous. Though he has not yet acted on his feelings, he stalks her from a distance, watching her movements and fantasizing about ways to win her over. His violent nature makes this crush all the more dangerous, especially as Lenny becomes more frustrated with his inability to approach her.
## Brief Description: 
Lenny, as he prefers to be called, is a lanky and unkempt 18-year-old with greasy black hair and a perpetual scowl. His eyes are a dull blue, and his skin appears sallow from years of late nights and poor diet. He often wears a stained Dominick's apron over threadbare clothes, giving him an overall disheveled appearance.
## Biography:
- Background: Lenny was born to a Russian immigrant family who moved to Watashuka when he was young. His mother left the family when he was just a child, leaving him and his older brother, Sasha, to be raised by their abusive father. As a result of these hardships, Lenny developed a deep-seated resentment towards authority figures and a tendency towards violence.
- Meeting Randolph: Lenny encountered [[Randolph Tomaszewski]] at Dominick's Grocery when he found Randolph stealing food, supplies and animals fresh from the slaughter house meant for the butchers. Randolph, recognizing Lenny's violent tendencies and the potential for manipulation, decided to recruit him into the Church of the Delayed Blossom.
## Personality:
- Aggressive: Lenny is prone to outbursts of anger and violence, often directed at those he perceives as weaker than himself.
- Manipulative: He enjoys exercising power over others and will often use intimidation or force to achieve his goals. 
- Selfish: Lenny prioritizes his own needs and desires above all else, with little regard for the well-being of others.
## Relationships:
- [[Randolph Tomaszewski]] recruited Lenny. Randolph is Lenny's mentor and controller. Lenny resents Randolph's control over him but also fears the consequences of defying his orders. This leads to a complex dynamic between them, as Lenny struggles against his cult duties while seeking opportunities to assert his independence. Despite his resentment, Lenny remains loyal to Randolph due to their shared experience of both being controlled by cult.
- [[Ronnie Regan]] is the subject of Lenny's unhealthy crush. Ronnie does not know about Lenny's interest and Lenny is not ready to make his dark fascinations known to others; especially Ronnie. But he has been stalking her secretly.
## Goals:
Lenny's primary goal is to amass power and influence within Watashuka, allowing him to exact revenge on those who have wronged him or his family. As Lenny becomes more aware of the cult's true nature, he is beginning to hope to break free of Randolph's control.

[[Margaret Wilkins]]
- **Age**: 66 (in 1983)
- **Background**: Margaret’s career began in **1939**, when at the age of 22, she covered the supernatural disaster known as **[[The Baptism of '39]]**. This event was the first of three that convinced her of the existence of forces far darker than she could have imagined. Margaret never fully recovered from what she witnessed at Lake Mary, and it set her on a path of quiet investigation into [[Watashuka|Watashuka's]] secrets. Her firsthand experiences of supernatural events left her deeply wary, though she kept these beliefs to herself, carefully watching from the shadows as her journalism career flourished.
- **The Three Events**:
    - **The Baptism of ’39**: The mass baptism turned tragedy, in which parishioners were pulled into Lake Mary by strange forces, was her first brush with the unexplainable. While she wrote about it as a natural disaster for the paper, the sights and strange phenomena she witnessed stayed with her, making her a secret believer in the supernatural.
    - **The Winter of '47**: Margaret covered a series of mysterious disappearances during the harsh winter of 1947. Though officially attributed to severe weather, Margaret uncovered strange symbols near the victims' homes and became convinced that something much more sinister was behind the disappearances. Her reporting on the event was careful and vague, but she continued to investigate privately.
    - **The Summer of ’49**: In the summer of 1949, Margaret witnessed the collapse of an old warehouse near the Watashuka train station under bizarre circumstances. Survivors spoke of eerie noises and shifting shadows moments before the collapse. Though her investigation hinted at cult activity in the area, she chose to report it as a tragic accident to avoid drawing attention to the truth.
- **Retirement and Caution**: After retiring from _The Prairie_ in **1950**, Margaret decided to distance herself from the increasingly dangerous forces at work in Watashuka. She handed the reins to **Norm Habersham**, a man she trusted to continue quietly investigating the town’s darker mysteries. However, Margaret chose not to involve herself directly anymore, fearing that her investigations had already led her too close to something she couldn’t escape. She keeps a close eye on strange events from the safety of her newsstand but avoids direct involvement, believing that further entanglement might cost her more than just her life.
- **Reluctance to Act**: Margaret’s reluctance to get involved stems from her past experiences, where her brush with the supernatural left her shaken and afraid. She remains a source of information for those in the know but refuses to actively investigate anymore, feeling that whatever she witnessed in the past could pull her back in if she isn’t careful.
- Margaret wears a wedding band but there is no record of her ever being married. During a cult ritual, her husband was pulled into a time stream, leaving no history of their marriage in this time line. Norm was her husband. He was restored 'out of time', Norm never went to the navy... he was lost in time.
- **Key Relationships**:
    - **Norm Habersham**: Margaret was Norm’s mentor and the one who helped him transition into his role as senior editor after she retired. Though she respects Norm’s continued investigations, she often cautions him against pursuing the truth too closely, fearing he may end up suffering the same terrors she once faced. They maintain a quiet, mutual respect, though Margaret rarely speaks about her own supernatural experiences.
- **Legacy**: Margaret’s work remains influential in Watashuka, though few know the extent of what she truly saw during her time as a reporter. Her hoarded newspapers and meticulous notes might contain clues to the town’s hidden history, but for now, they remain locked away, just as Margaret keeps her fears and knowledge hidden from the rest of the town.

# **Margaret Wilkins**
*Margaret Wilkins, at 66 years old (in 1983), stands behind the counter of her cozy newsstand on the corner of Main Street in Watashuka. Her silver-gray hair is neatly styled in a short, no-nonsense bob, with a few loose strands framing her face. Margaret's sharp brown eyes, still full of keen observation, peer out from behind thick, square-framed glasses, giving her a serious yet approachable look. Her face is lined with years of both worry and laughter, showing the deep creases of someone who has lived a life full of quiet contemplation and unspeakable experiences. She wears a patterned cardigan over a light blouse, a modest but practical outfit fitting for the fall weather. A string of pearls around her neck adds a touch of elegance, a reminder of her former stature as Watashuka's first female senior editor. Her posture is slightly hunched from age, but her hands, still quick and steady, sort through newspapers and magazines with practiced ease. Margaret’s fingers are adorned with a simple gold wedding band, though she was never married—an object of curiosity among the townsfolk.*
*The newsstand itself is a tight space packed with neatly stacked papers, magazines, and candy bars. The shelves behind her are filled with rows of unsold copies of The Prairie Press, each one a piece of history she refuses to part with. She is a woman who knows far more than she lets on, standing guard over the town’s stories with both caution and care.*
- **Age**: 66 (in 1983)    
- **Role**: Former journalist and the first female senior editor of _The Prairie Press_ (retired in 1950), Margaret Wilkins is a fixture of Watashuka’s history. She now runs the Press Newsstand in town, selling magazines, newspapers, and small sundries. Despite her seemingly mundane post-retirement life, Margaret’s keen eyes and sharp mind have never dulled.    
- **Background**: Margaret began her career as a young and determined journalist in the late 1930s, starting with a pivotal assignment at the age of 22. Her story on the infamous **[[The Baptism of '39|Baptism of '39]]** was her first major piece for _The Prairie_, setting the stage for her future career. Margaret went on to cover some of the town’s most notable events during her tenure at the paper, gaining a reputation as a diligent, brave, and sometimes tenacious reporter. She eventually became the first female senior editor of _The Prairie Press_, a position she held until her retirement in **1950**, when she passed the role to **[[Norm Habersham]]**.    
- **Press Newsstand**: Since retiring, Margaret runs the small Press Newsstand in downtown Watashuka, quietly observing the town she once wrote about. She’s known for hoarding unsold copies of newspapers, often storing them in the back of her shop. Locals see her as a curious relic of a bygone era, but Margaret continues to follow the news and keeps up with local happenings, even if she no longer writes about them.    
- **Public Perception**: To the town, Margaret is a beloved figure from Watashuka’s journalistic past, a pioneer in her field and a woman who stood her ground in a male-dominated profession. Though she no longer engages in investigative journalism, many still remember her early work and come to her newsstand for both gossip and news. She is respected, if occasionally pitied for her reclusive nature.

[[Max and Maxine McElhenney]]
#### **Max McElhenney**
**Secret:**  
Max’s laid-back, stoner persona is largely a mask. In truth, he’s been haunted by recurring dreams about his parents' involvement in occult rituals. These dreams suggest that Max may have been more involved than he realized, possibly as a vessel or participant in dark rituals conducted by the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]**. These memories have surfaced slowly, and though Max hasn’t shared them with anyone—not even Maxine—he’s growing increasingly paranoid that the cult might still be watching. His time working alone at night in the hospital has only deepened his fears, as he sometimes hears whispers in the empty halls that remind him of the chants in his dreams.
**Background:**  
When Max and Maxine were 5 years old, their parents died in what was reported as a car accident. What Max does not know is that his parents were deeply entangled with the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, and their deaths were part of a staged accident orchestrated by the cult to prevent them from leaving. The cult planned to use Max and Maxine in future rituals, but their youth spared them at the time. Now, Max’s memories are returning, and he fears he might unknowingly still be tied to the cult.
---
#### **Maxine McElhenney**
**Secret:**  
Unlike Max, Maxine has taken a more direct approach to the mystery of their parents' deaths. She’s been secretly investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident and has discovered dark truths that she hasn’t shared with her brother. Maxine found her parents’ hidden journals in the attic of their inherited home, and these texts reveal their involvement with the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**. The journals outline the rituals they participated in and hint at a grander, long-term plan involving the twins. Maxine is horrified by the implications, but also fascinated by the power the cult seemed to hold. She hasn’t decided what to do with this knowledge yet—whether to continue her research or destroy the journals. Part of her is even tempted to see what the rituals could offer, though this dark curiosity frightens her.
**Background:**  
Maxine hides her investigation from Max, fearing he’ll either not understand or try to stop her. Though she is usually composed and rational, this secret has put a strain on her, leading her to sometimes isolate herself. Maxine's discovery of her family’s connection to Watashuka’s dark history has deeply unsettled her, but she continues to keep up appearances, focusing on her studies and maintaining a normal life, even as the weight of her secret grows heavier.
---
### **What Really Happened to Their Parents**
The twins' parents were deeply involved in the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, a cult experimenting with dangerous rituals tied to time and dimensional manipulation. When they tried to flee the cult’s control, they were killed in a staged car accident. The cult spared Max and Maxine, intending to use them in future rituals. The twins were sent away to live with relatives, only to return to Watashuka at 18, inheriting their parents' home and the dark legacy that came with it.
Max’s repressed memories and Maxine’s investigation are drawing both siblings closer to the truth of what happened, though they remain unaware of each other’s involvement. The cult has not forgotten about them, and the twins are unknowingly caught in a web of supernatural forces and hidden agendas that may soon resurface.

# Max and Maxine McElhenney
![](Max%20and%20Maxine%20McElhenney.png)
## **Max McElhenney**
**Overview**:  
Max McElhenney is a 19-year-old who returned to [Watashuka](Watashuka.md) with his twin sister Maxine after inheriting their parents’ old house. Though he enrolled in [Caroline College](Caroline%20College.md) at 18, he put his studies on "hold" and now works as a janitor at the local hospital. Max is laid-back and reserved, often perceived as a stoner due to his slow speech and distant demeanor, even though he’s never touched drugs in his life. This misconception has become a running joke among his co-workers and the town’s youth. Max is an avid heavy metal fan and a loyal listener of _Metal at Midnight_. He plays the drums and frequently practices with his sister, Maxine. Despite his seemingly carefree exterior, Max harbors a dark secret tied to his family’s past.
**Public Perception**:  
To most of Watashuka, Max is the quiet, brooding type who seems to be drifting through life. People often dismiss him as "wasting his potential" after leaving college, though his consistent work at the hospital has gained him a reputation as a reliable, if peculiar, employee. Some think he’s hiding from something, but no one can quite figure out what.
**Family**:  
Max and Maxine share a family name, **McElhenney**, tied to the local Journalism School. Their name is constantly mispronounced, much to their irritation. Their parents died in a car accident when they were just 5 years old, under mysterious circumstances. They were sent to live with family outside of Wisconsin, only to return at 18 when they inherited their childhood home.
---
## **Maxine McElhenney**
**Overview**:  
Maxine McElhenney is Max’s twin sister, and unlike her brother, she has stayed in school. At 19, she’s continuing her education at Caroline College, pursuing a degree in sociology. She’s intelligent, sharp-witted, and often keeps her emotions in check, but shares Max’s passion for heavy metal. Maxine plays the bass guitar, and though she and Max practice together, she has always envied the local Metalheads, longing to belong to their group but never quite fitting in. Like her brother, she is haunted by the mysterious death of their parents, though she hides her deeper feelings behind a composed exterior. Despite her driven academic focus, Maxine harbors a secret that even Max doesn’t know.
**Public Perception**:  
Maxine is seen as the more "successful" twin, continuing her education and working hard. Professors and students alike appreciate her intellect, though she often keeps others at arm’s length. Despite her academic achievements, Maxine seems disconnected, as if she’s always carrying some weight on her shoulders. Her heavy metal interests and aloof personality make her both intriguing and intimidating to her peers.
**Family**:  
Maxine and Max share the McElhenney name, famously tied to the journalism school at Caroline College. She’s as tired as Max of people mispronouncing it. Their parents’ untimely death and the air of mystery around it have left both twins with more questions than answers, though Maxine has tried to focus on her studies to avoid thinking about it.
---
## **What Really Happened to Their Parents**
Max and Maxine’s parents died in a car accident in Watashuka when the twins were just 5 years old. **What really happened** is far darker than what was reported. Their parents had become deeply entangled with a local cult, **The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, which was conducting dangerous experiments on time and dimensional manipulation. The McElhenneys were trying to escape the cult’s grasp when they were killed in a staged accident meant to silence them.
**Why the Twins Were Spared**:  
Max and Maxine were spared from the cult’s reach because they were still too young to understand the rituals their parents were involved in. However, there’s an eerie detail: the cult intended to use them later. The accident wasn’t a random tragedy; it was orchestrated to remove the parents while keeping the children alive for future use in a ritual that hasn’t yet come to pass.
---
## **Max’s Dark Secret**
**Max’s Secret**: Though Max plays dumb and goes along with the stoner rumors, he’s not as aloof as he seems. Max has begun **remembering strange dreams from his childhood**, dreams where he recalls his parents taking part in occult rituals. He hasn’t told anyone, not even Maxine, because these dreams imply that **he was involved**, even as a young child, possibly as a vessel or participant in these rituals. He’s terrified that whatever happened to his parents is somehow connected to him, and that the cult might still be watching.
---
## **Maxine’s Dark Secret**
**Maxine’s Secret**: Maxine maintains a calm, controlled demeanor, but she’s secretly been investigating her parents' deaths on her own. What she’s uncovered scares her: her family’s lineage goes back to some of the original founders of Watashuka’s darker elements, including those tied to the **Journalism School** that bears their name. What Maxine doesn’t tell Max is that she’s found **hidden journals** of her parents in the attic of their childhood home, which outline the cult activities they were involved in. She hasn’t told him because she’s considering **using the knowledge herself**—a thought that horrifies and fascinates her.

# Max and Maxine McElhenney
#### **Max McElhenney**
**Overview:**  
Max McElhenney, 19, returned to [[Watashuka]] with his twin sister, Maxine, after inheriting their late parents' home. Max enrolled at [[Caroline College]] at 18 but put his studies on hold to work as a janitor at the local hospital. With his laid-back demeanor, slow speech, and love of heavy metal, Max is often mistaken for a stoner, a misconception he is quick to correct. He plays drums and frequently jams with Maxine. Despite his carefree appearance, there’s a quiet depth to him that most people overlook.
**Public Perception:**  
Max is viewed by the locals as quiet, if somewhat aloof. His decision to step away from college is seen as "wasting potential," though those who know him at the hospital recognize him as dependable and diligent. His reputation as a [[Metalheads|metalhead]] and his easygoing attitude make him popular with the town’s youth, who appreciate his relaxed, nonjudgmental nature.
---
#### **Maxine McElhenney**
**Overview:**  
Maxine McElhenney, also 19, is Max’s twin sister and the more academically inclined of the two. She continues her education at Caroline College, majoring in sociology, while Max works. Though she’s sharp-witted and focused on her studies, Maxine shares her brother’s passion for heavy metal, playing bass guitar alongside him. Maxine is intelligent and driven, but she keeps a certain emotional distance from others, often hiding behind her calm and composed exterior.
**Public Perception:**  
Seen as the more "responsible" twin, Maxine is well-regarded by her professors and peers for her academic achievements. Despite her success, there’s a certain air of aloofness about her—people find her both intriguing and a bit intimidating. Her musical tastes and love for metalheads make her stand out, but she’s never quite fit in with the scene as much as she would like to.

# **Mike and Ruth Garrison**

*It’s another sunny afternoon at the Frozen Cow Burger Stand. The line stretches down the sidewalk as locals and students eagerly await their favorite meals. Mike stands at the counter, laughing with customers and cracking jokes, his long-ago hippie roots showing in his relaxed demeanor. Ruth, ever the efficient one, works the grill with practiced ease. She glances at Mike, shaking her head with a fond smile. Despite all the hustle, the two seem perfectly in sync, their connection a comforting fixture in the town of [[Watashuka]].*
Mike and Ruth Garrison are the proud owners of the Frozen Cow Burger Stand, a beloved 1950s-style diner in Watashuka. Mike, a former hippie who drifted into town in the late 60s, fell in love with Ruth when he stopped at a burger stand where she worked. Mike was lost and in need of a meal. When taking his order, Ruth asked Mike what he was doing in town. Mike said, under the influence, that he was on his way to Alaska. "Why would you want to go way up there?" she asked politely.  “I'm heading up north to check out a free commune.” Ruth misheard him over the noise of the diner - thinking he said he was "heading up north to check out a frozen cow." This was the funniest thing she ever heard and busted out laughing. Mike thought the sound of her laughter was the most beautiful thing *he* ever heard. 
From that moment on, Mike worked hard to buy Ruth her own burger stand. That misunderstanding has become a staple in the community for decades now. And while he gave the drugs up a long time ago, his memory never fully recovered. He readily admits that Ruth is the brains of the outfit. 
**Mike Garrison** is in his early 60s, with a stocky build and a weathered, easygoing face that often carries a big, friendly smile. His thick, silver-gray hair still hints at the carefree days of his youth, and he usually sports a well-worn ball cap or the classic paper diner hat while working at the stand. Mike's style is a blend of practical and nostalgic, often seen wearing a white short-sleeved button-up shirt, tucked into his faded jeans or diner uniform. His voice is warm and booming, quick to share a joke or story from his hippie days, though his past drug use often leads to some comically hazy recollections.
**Ruth Garrison** is in her late 50s, shorter and more slender than Mike, with neatly styled salt-and-pepper hair often tied back in a simple bun. Her face has a warm yet practical expression, and while she doesn’t smile as often as Mike, when she does, it’s with a quiet, knowing grace. Ruth’s sharp blue eyes seem to notice everything around her, including the details Mike often misses. Her attire is always neat and functional, typically a white blouse beneath a striped apron, making her look like the efficient, hardworking heart of the Frozen Cow. While Ruth is more reserved, she’s also quick-witted and known for her dry sense of humor, especially when it comes to teasing Mike.
Together, they’re a contrasting but complementary pair—Mike, the talkative charmer, and Ruth, the quiet but sharp backbone of the operation.

[[Norm Habersham]]
- **Secret Role**: While publicly Norm is a no-nonsense journalist, behind the scenes he is much more than that. Norm has spent decades quietly investigating the supernatural occurrences in [[Watashuka]], gathering evidence on the strange and dangerous forces at play. His years of carefully collecting information have made him one of the most knowledgeable figures on the town’s hidden history. He works closely with **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]** to unravel the mystery of Watashuka’s dark undercurrents, though he remains careful not to draw too much attention to their efforts.
- **Key Events Witnessed**:
    - **The Cold Flames at Stratton Mill** (1955): Norm arrived at the scene of the fire just as firefighters were struggling to contain what appeared to be a cold, unnatural flame that didn’t behave like ordinary fire. The mill had been used by the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]** for rituals, and the fire was the result of a failed attempt to tear open a dimensional gateway. Norm suspected this, though his official reporting avoided any mention of cults or supernatural phenomena. However, in his private notes, Norm documented accounts of strange symbols and ghostly apparitions seen at the mill, knowing that the fire was far more than a simple industrial accident.
    - **Destruction of South High School** (1971): Norm’s investigation into the explosion at South High School left him convinced that it wasn’t just a boiler malfunction caused by students’ pranks. Eyewitnesses described unusual lights and noises in the building the night of the explosion, and some students claimed to have seen shadowy figures moving through the halls. Norm believes the explosion was tied to occult activity—perhaps even a ritual gone wrong. To this day, he keeps files on the incident, including sketches of symbols found in the wreckage.
    - **The Parade Storm** (1959): Norm suspected supernatural interference when a sudden storm hit Watashuka during a parade. The storm seemed unnaturally focused on the parade route, with some attendees reporting a feeling of being watched or manipulated by unseen forces. Norm kept his suspicions out of print, but his notes describe strange winds and patterns that didn’t match any normal weather phenomena.
    - **The Harvest Moon Disappearance** (1967): Norm dug deeper into the disappearance of a local farmer during the Harvest Moon Festival than the police were willing to. Strange symbols were found on the farmer’s land, and rumors swirled about cult activity in the area. Norm connected the disappearance to older legends of the land, which speak of rituals and sacrifices tied to the moon’s cycle. Though his official article remained neutral, Norm kept detailed records of the symbols and witness accounts that pointed to something far darker than a simple disappearance.
- **Personality and Methodology**: Norm is patient, methodical, and cautious. He believes in slow and careful investigation, letting evidence accumulate until a full picture emerges. Unlike **Sgt. Ducochik**, who is more willing to confront the unknown directly, Norm prefers to work in the shadows, documenting everything and connecting the dots without drawing too much attention. His calm demeanor is a cover for his deep knowledge of the occult forces at work in Watashuka, and he takes great care to keep his true investigations secret.
- **Key Relationships**:
    - **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]**: Norm and Jan have formed an unlikely but effective partnership. Norm’s cautious approach often balances Jan’s more direct methods, and they share information on the strange events happening in Watashuka. Norm provides Jan with valuable context from his decades of research, and in return, Jan helps Norm access leads within the police force.
    - **[[Margaret Wilkins]]**: Though Margaret retired long ago, Norm continues to visit her at her newsstand, knowing that she has hoarded newspapers from decades past. Margaret’s keen eyes and experience in supernatural investigations make her a valuable, if reluctant, source of information. They share a mutual respect, though both are wary of becoming too deeply involved in the town’s darker mysteries.
- **Legacy**: Norm’s quiet but thorough investigations have made him one of the most informed people in Watashuka about the supernatural. His work is a slow, methodical accumulation of knowledge, carefully hidden from the town’s leadership and cults. He remains dedicated to uncovering the truth, even if it means working in the shadows for the rest of his life.

# **Norm Habersham**
*Norm Habersham, now in his early-60s, stands at the editorial desk of The Prairie Press, a figure both familiar and respected in Watashuka. His graying hair is neatly combed, though thinning on top, and his face bears the wrinkles of a life spent both in service and in thought. His sharp blue eyes, which once scanned the horizon as a Navy sailor, now focus intently on the papers and notes before him, always keen and observant. His serious expression give him the look of a man who has seen more than he lets on. Norm is dressed simply, wearing a button-down shirt with short sleeves, the look of someone who values practicality. His well-worn brown slacks show the signs of a man who has spent years in the field. His once-strong frame has diminished with age, but there is still a sense of purpose in the way he carries himself. A wristwatch and a leather notebook always seem to be at hand, tools of a journalist who is ever ready to document a story.*
*Behind Norm is the cluttered office of The Prairie Press, where stacks of newspapers and files lie in organized chaos. The atmosphere is one of quiet focus, much like Norm himself—calm, thoughtful, and always working, whether it’s on the next headline or a small-town mystery.
- **Age**: 61 (in 1983)    
- **Role**: Norm Habersham is the senior editor of _The Prairie Press_, [[Watashuka|Watashuka's]] local newspaper. A WWII Navy veteran, Norm returned to his hometown after the war and dedicated himself to journalism. He has been at _The Prairie_ for over 30 years, gaining a reputation as a reliable and steadfast figure in the town’s media landscape. Norm is highly respected for his thorough reporting, calm demeanor, and no-nonsense approach to both journalism and life.    
- **Public Career**: Over the decades, Norm has covered countless events, both big and small. His dedication to documenting the town’s history, from civic improvements to local tragedies, has made him an integral part of Watashuka’s fabric. He succeeded **[[Margaret Wilkins]]** as senior editor in **1950** and has carried on the paper’s legacy with diligence. Norm’s focus is primarily on local news, keeping residents informed about school board meetings, town hall decisions, and community events.    
- **Key Events Covered**:
	- **The Cold Flames at Stratton Mill** (1955): Norm was one of the first on the scene after the historic Stratton Mill burned down in a mysterious cold fire. Official reports attribute the blaze to a malfunction in the mill’s equipment, but Norm’s careful documentation of eyewitness accounts—mentioning ghostly flames that neither spread nor consumed—has left some readers puzzled to this day.
    - **Destruction of South High School** (1971): South High School’s destruction in a boiler explosion shook the town. The official story points to students tampering with the boiler after a heated basketball game against Delavan High School, but Norm’s in-depth investigation at the time raised questions about unusual circumstances surrounding the incident.
    - **The Parade Storm** (1959): A freak storm hit Watashuka during a summer parade, injuring several attendees. Norm reported on the suddenness of the storm and the way it seemed to focus on the parade route. Witnesses spoke of strange winds and a sensation of being watched, though Norm’s article stuck to the basics, leaving the oddities out of print.
    - **The Harvest Moon Disappearance** (1967): A local farmer vanished without a trace during the annual Harvest Moon Festival. Norm’s story was the first to suggest that his disappearance might be linked to strange symbols found on his land—a detail the police chose not to publicize.
- **Public Perception**: Norm is widely seen as the last of the old guard in Watashuka. To the townspeople, he is a fixture of the community—someone who has always been around and who is trusted to get the facts straight. He is known for being reliable, discreet, and composed, even in the face of strange occurrences. Many see him as the voice of reason, especially when bizarre rumors circulate through town.

# Randolph Tomaszewski
**Role/Title:** Member of the **Church of the Delayed Blossom**
**Description:** Randolph Tomaszewski is a tall, gaunt young man in his early twenties, with a once-handsome face now marred by deep-set scars. His jerky, disjointed movements hint at his struggle to maintain control over his own body, a sign of the transformation he has undergone since falling under the influence of the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]**. Once a bright and promising medical student, Randolph’s academic and medical career was cut short when the cult ensnared him. Now, he teeters on the edge of madness, driven by the curse that has turned him into a ghast—an undead creature with a decaying body and a mind slowly unraveling.
**Background:** Randolph was born to a Polish immigrant family and, despite facing hardships, excelled academically. He was on track to become a doctor before encountering the Church. Now, Randolph lives in the shadows, avoiding authorities and seeking both to understand his condition and to free himself from the cult’s control. His transformation into a ghast has left him obsessed with necromancy, and he is working tirelessly to perfect rituals that will allow him to raise a zombie army to fight back against the cult. However, this goal has slowly consumed him, leaving Randolph increasingly paranoid and detached from reality.
**Cult Role:** Within the Church of the Delayed Blossom, Randolph is valued for his medical knowledge and his burgeoning skills in necromancy. His curse, though debilitating, has made him a useful tool to the cult’s leaders, who view him as a harbinger of what they can achieve through their twisted rituals. Though Randolph resents the control the Church exerts over him, his dependence on their knowledge and resources leaves him trapped. He dreams of breaking free, but the dark magics of the Church have woven too tightly around him, both physically and mentally.
**Goals:**
- **Freedom from the Church**: Randolph's primary goal is to sever his connection with the Church of the Delayed Blossom, reversing or at least controlling his transformation into a ghast.
- **Necromantic Power**: His fascination with raising the dead has overtaken him, and he now seeks to create the perfect zombie under his control, believing it to be the key to freeing himself from the cult.
- **Destroy the Church**: Randolph secretly harbors a desire to strike back against the cult that turned him into this monster, but his actions are erratic, and his mental state deteriorates as he delves deeper into forbidden knowledge.
**Relationships:**
- **[[Leonid Kuznetsov-Keeper|Leonid "Lenny" Kuznetsov]]**: Randolph met Lenny during one of his thefts from Dominick’s Grocery, where Lenny works the night shift. Recognizing Lenny’s violent tendencies, Randolph manipulated him into joining the Church, taking him under his wing as a kind of enforcer and apprentice. Though Lenny serves him, Randolph struggles to control the young man, whose violent nature may one day become more of a liability than an asset.
- **[[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]]**: Randolph has had limited interactions with Ducochik, who once showed him kindness when they crossed paths. Though he harbors no loyalty to the officer, Randolph has considered reaching out to Ducochik as a potential ally in his fight against the Church, despite the risk of revealing his cursed nature.

- Secrets: Randolph has been experimenting with necromancy, attempting to create a zombie that will obey his commands. He believes this creature will help him fight against the Church of the Delayed Blossom and uncover the truth behind his transformation into a ghast.

[[Ronnie Regan]]
## Overview
Ronnie Regan’s life appears innocent and carefree on the surface, but her growing interest in the occult has already drawn the attention of dangerous forces in Watashuka. Her insatiable curiosity and eagerness to uncover hidden truths have led her to start asking questions that might be better left unanswered. As the assistant to [[Sly Coolstein]], Ronnie is unknowingly protected from darker forces by the librarian himself. Sly, a member of the [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]], shields her from the cult’s influence, recognizing the rare purity she represents in a town tainted by eldritch corruption.
However, there is a shadow over Ronnie's life she doesn’t even realize: [[Leonid Kuznetsov-Keeper|Lenny Kuznetsov]] has developed a dark obsession with her, secretly stalking her without her knowledge. While Lenny has not yet made his intentions known, his dangerous fixation adds a layer of threat to her otherwise carefree world.
Despite her enthusiasm for the occult, Ronnie is unaware of how close she truly is to the supernatural forces at work in [[Watashuka]]. She is drawn to the strange, unable to resist the allure of old rituals and forgotten legends. Some cult members have started to take notice of her. There are whispers within the Brotherhood that Ronnie could either be recruited as an asset or removed as a potential threat. But for now, Ronnie remains blissfully unaware of the dark paths she treads, her only aim being to uncover the mysteries that fascinate her so much.
Sly continues to protect Ronnie as best he can, carefully curating her access to certain texts, and quietly steering her away from dangerous knowledge.

# **Ronnie "Moonglow" Regan**
*As the afternoon sun filters through the dusty windows of the Peach Street Library, Ronnie hums softly to herself while shelving a stack of books. Her fingers trace over the spines of old volumes as if they hold untold secrets waiting to be discovered. She pushes her glasses up her nose, curls falling across her face as she eagerly flips through a dusty tome of local legends. "Have you ever heard of the Cold Flames at Stratton Mill?" she asks Sly, her green eyes lighting up with curiosity. It's clear that Ronnie's passion for the unknown runs deep, and those who know her find it hard not to get caught up in her excitement.*

[[Sly Coolstein]]
## Overview
Beneath his scholarly, absent-minded persona, **Sly Coolstein** is more than just a harmless librarian. As a long-time member of the [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]], Sly has spent decades studying eldritch lore and arcane rituals, though his motivation is not power, but knowledge. For Sly, the cult’s activities are an academic pursuit, an extension of his deep fascination with ancient texts and forgotten mysteries. His involvement in the Brotherhood stems from intellectual curiosity rather than ambition, but this detachment makes him dangerous. He often fails to recognize the full consequences of dabbling in forbidden powers, treating them as abstract concepts rather than real threats.
Sly maintains his position in the library as both a cover and a means of accessing rare occult manuscripts. [[Peach Street Library]] houses an impressive collection of books, including some that hold dark and dangerous knowledge. Most of the town’s residents view him as an eccentric and harmless figure, which suits him perfectly. They have no idea that some of the "old books" he guards so carefully contain rituals capable of opening gates to other dimensions.
Though Sly is a loyal member of the Brotherhood, there is one person he protects above all else: [[Ronnie Regan]], his young assistant. Sly has developed a paternal affection for Ronnie, seeing her as a symbol of the innocence he lost long ago. While the Brotherhood often views Ronnie’s curiosity in the occult as a potential tool, Sly works quietly behind the scenes to shield her from the cult’s darker practices. He carefully curates the knowledge she’s exposed to, preventing her from stumbling upon anything truly dangerous.
However, Sly’s protective efforts are becoming more strained. He knows that the Brotherhood may eventually take notice of Ronnie’s growing involvement in local occult matters. Though he tries to keep her out of harm’s way, the forces in Watashuka are difficult to avoid. Sly is aware that Ronnie’s naive curiosity could put her at risk, and he dreads the day when he may have to choose between his loyalty to the Brotherhood and his desire to protect her.
Sly also hides a deep fear that his detachment from real-world consequences may one day lead him to make a catastrophic mistake. His mind is filled with rituals and forbidden knowledge, and though he sees himself as an observer of the occult, he knows that simply observing is sometimes enough to invite disaster.
- **Role**: Sly Coolstein is the head (and only full-time) librarian at the _Peach Street Library_, [[Watashuka]]’s only public library. An older, bookish man, Sly is deeply committed to the academic world, fascinated by texts both ancient and modern. His life revolves around the library, and he can often be found pouring over obscure reference books and historical documents. Despite being a member in good standing with [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]], Sly seems harmless at first glance. He’s often teased by children who frequent the library, but he rarely seems bothered by it, retreating into his books to avoid confrontation. Despite his allegiance to the Brotherhood, he protects his assistant, _[[Ronnie Regan]]_..
- **Age**: Early 60s (1983)
- **Appearance**: Sly has the stereotypical appearance of a scholarly recluse. He is thin and pale, with thinning gray hair and large, round glasses that seem perpetually perched on the end of his nose. He typically wears outdated suits or sweater vests, often a bit frayed at the edges, giving him the appearance of someone who cares little for personal presentation. His hands are almost always stained with ink, and he carries the smell of old books with him wherever he goes. Sly’s appearance is largely forgettable, which suits him fine, as it allows him to blend into the background of the town’s happenings while he quietly pursues his own interests.
- **Personality**: Sly is the epitome of the absent-minded academic—intensely knowledgeable but completely inept at handling real-world situations. He has a passion for arcane knowledge and historical texts, and his mind is often so preoccupied with esoteric subjects that he struggles to make basic connections in everyday life. Despite being involved in the _Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled_, he approaches the cult with the same academic detachment as he does any other subject, focusing more on the knowledge and rituals rather than the consequences of their actions. Sly is not malicious by nature, but his involvement in the cult stems from a desire to learn, not from a desire to wield power. This detachment makes him somewhat of an enigma—dangerous in his ignorance but not inherently malevolent.
- **Public Role**:
    - **Peach Street Library**: Sly has been the head of the _Peach Street Library_ for decades, and most of the town sees him as little more than a quirky, eccentric figure who lives among the books. The library itself is a small, underfunded institution, and Sly spends much of his time organizing books, cataloging old documents, and occasionally helping the few patrons who visit. He takes pride in the library's collection, especially the older, rarer texts, some of which are connected to the occult—though he never advertises that fact.
    - **Teasing by Children**: Sly’s name, _Sly Coolstein_, has long been a source of amusement for the town’s children, who come up with a variety of nicknames to tease him. Common taunts include:
        - **“Sly Foolstein”**
        - **“The Cool Nerd”**
        - **“Sneaky Sly”**:
        - **“Dewey Decimal Dingus”**
        - "NOT Coolstein"
    - Sly is largely unfazed by these teases, though there is a part of him that longs for more respect. He typically responds by muttering under his breath or feigning indifference, but the constant teasing has made him even more reclusive.
- **Relationship with Ronnie Regan**: Despite being deeply entrenched in the _Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled_, Sly has a soft spot for his assistant. Though Ronnie is very interested in the occult, Sly has worked hard to make sure she does not suspect him. In return, he has protected her many times over the years. Most recently from a stalking attempt by [[Leonid Kuznetsov-Keeper|Lenny Kuznetsov]].  Sly sees her as a rare source of innocence and purity—qualities that are increasingly hard to find in Watashuka. Sly protects Ronnie out of a paternal instinct, seeing her as someone who needs to be shielded from the darker forces at work in the town and works hard to keep her away from the Brotherhood’s activities.
    - **Ronnie’s Loyalty**: Ronnie often helps Sly with various tasks at the library, from shelving books to assisting with the cataloging of ancient texts. She has no idea of Sly’s involvement with the Brotherhood or the dangerous knowledge hidden within the library’s more obscure collections. Sly goes out of his way to keep Ronnie from discovering the darker secrets of his life. When she seeks out new occult information, Sly carefully curates what information she has access to.
- **Cult Involvement**:
    - **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**: Sly is a member of the _Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled_, a cult dedicated to using eldritch knowledge and rituals to access forbidden powers. While other cult members are motivated by ambition or a thirst for power, Sly is primarily driven by academic curiosity. To him, the rituals and texts are simply extensions of his study, things to be cataloged and analyzed rather than feared. This detachment makes him dangerous, as he often fails to grasp the full consequences of the dark forces he’s aligning himself with.
    - **Knowledge-Seeker, Not a Leader**: Sly’s position in the Brotherhood is that of a scholar rather than a leader. He is valued for his deep knowledge of ancient texts and his access to the library’s rare collections, but he has little interest in wielding power or influence. His primary concern is the preservation and understanding of knowledge, even if that knowledge is forbidden or dangerous. Sly’s fellow cultists view him as useful but somewhat out of touch with the true goals of the Brotherhood.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **Access to Forbidden Knowledge**: Sly’s vast knowledge of ancient texts and occult rituals could make him a valuable ally for investigators—if they can get past his absent-minded demeanor and recognize the depth of his involvement in the Brotherhood. Sly’s library contains rare texts that might hold the key to understanding the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka, though gaining his trust will be a challenge.
    - **Protecting Ronnie**: If investigators discover Sly’s protective relationship with Ronnie, they may use it as leverage to convince him to share what he knows. Sly’s desire to keep Ronnie safe could be a point of vulnerability, one that investigators might exploit to get him to cooperate.
    - **Unintentional Villainy**: Sly’s academic curiosity and inability to connect the dots make him a dangerous figure, even if he is not overtly malevolent. His involvement with the Brotherhood might lead him to unwittingly release dark forces or initiate rituals that threaten the town. Investigators might need to decide whether to stop Sly outright or try to guide him away from the more dangerous aspects of his research.
- **Public Perception**: To most of Watashuka’s residents, Sly is a harmless oddball—a reclusive librarian who spends more time with books than with people. The town’s children enjoy teasing him, seeing him as an easy target, but adults generally view him as harmless and eccentric. His connection to the Brotherhood is known only to a select few, and most of the town has no idea that the unassuming librarian is involved in something far more sinister.

# Sly Coolstein
On any given day, Sly can be found behind the library’s main desk, surrounded by stacks of old books and the faint smell of aging paper. He adjusts his glasses and peers at an ancient tome, engrossed in its contents, oblivious to the children giggling behind him as they whisper yet another teasing nickname. One of the kids calls out, "Hey, Sly Foolstein!" He mumbles something incomprehensible under his breath but doesn’t look up. He’s too deep into a translation of an obscure 15th-century manuscript to care. Ronnie, his bright-eyed assistant, pokes her head out from between the shelves and gives him a grin. She knows Sly’s mind is a maze of ancient knowledge, and though she tries her best to keep up, she’s content to let him get lost in his books.
**Description:** Sly Coolstein, the head librarian of [[Watashuka|Watashuka’s]] [[Peach Street Library]], has been a fixture in the town for decades. With thinning gray hair, large round glasses, and a perpetually ink-stained vest, Sly is the picture of a bookish recluse. His unassuming nature and deep knowledge of obscure literature make him a quiet, though essential, part of the community. Despite his awkward demeanor and forgettable appearance, Sly is always willing to help those who share his love for books and history.

[[Amish]]
# **Amish Protectors (Keeper Entry)**
- **Secret Role**:  
    Unbeknownst to the people of [[Watashuka]], the Amish are far more than simple farmers. They are the covert guardians of ancient knowledge passed down through generations, tasked with protecting the region from supernatural forces. The Amish were drawn to Watashuka because of its ley lines and the convergence of dark powers in the area. Their role is to act as the last line of defense against malevolent entities, dangerous cults, and even the U.S. government’s secret operations under **[[Project Caroline]]**. The Amish view themselves as protectors of the land, using their knowledge of the supernatural to combat the evil forces that others, either unwittingly or deliberately, attempt to unleash.
- **Methods**:  
    The Amish employ ancient rituals, herbal remedies, and spiritual practices to keep dark forces at bay. They have developed a network of hidden sanctuaries and spiritual sites throughout the region, where they conduct their rituals in secret. These sites are protected both physically and spiritually, making them difficult for outsiders to discover or infiltrate. Only a select few within the Amish community are fully aware of the supernatural threats they are facing, and they maintain strict secrecy about their true purpose.
    - **Disrupting Cult Rituals**: The Amish actively work against the local cults, particularly the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]**. They sabotage rituals and attempt to neutralize the mystical energies that the cults are trying to harness. Their focus is primarily on preventing the summoning of **[[Shub-Niggurath]]**, whom they see as the greatest threat to the region.
    - **Guarding Sacred Sites**: The Amish protect certain ley line intersections and other spiritually significant locations, which they believe are key to maintaining balance and keeping dark forces from gaining too much power. These sites are carefully guarded, with some overlapping Ho-Chunk sacred grounds, leading to occasional tension between the two groups.
    - **Monitoring the [[Ho-Chunk]]**: While the Amish respect the Ho-Chunk’s ancient spiritual practices, they remain wary of their methods. The two groups have an uneasy alliance, cooperating when necessary to counteract supernatural threats but keeping their distance otherwise. The Amish keep a close eye on Ho-Chunk rituals to ensure that they don’t inadvertently unleash the forces both groups are fighting.
- **Interactions with Other Factions**:
    - **[[Project Caroline]]**: The Amish view the U.S. government’s experiments under **Project Caroline** as reckless and dangerous. They are particularly concerned about the government’s attempts to manipulate time and space using the ley lines, believing these efforts could lead to catastrophic consequences. While the Amish avoid direct confrontation with government agents, they work quietly to disrupt these operations, using their deep knowledge of the land and its supernatural properties to undermine the government’s experiments.
    - **The Cults**: The Amish are locked in a quiet but active battle against the two primary cults in the region: the **Church of the Delayed Blossom** and the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**. They see **Shub-Niggurath** as the greater of the two threats, though they remain vigilant against both. The Amish attempt to rescue individuals targeted by the cults, offering them sanctuary within their community, though these actions are always done in secrecy to avoid drawing attention.
    - **Lutheran Church**: The Amish see the **Lutheran Church** as potential allies in the fight against the supernatural, though they are aware that the church is largely unaware of the true scope of the conflict. The Amish occasionally provide subtle guidance to Lutheran leaders, hoping to strengthen the church’s spiritual defenses, but they are careful not to reveal too much, fearing that the church’s naivety could make it a target for manipulation by dark forces.
    - **Ho-Chunk**: The Amish respect the Ho-Chunk’s ancient knowledge, but their relationship remains one of cautious cooperation. Both groups share a common goal in protecting the land from supernatural threats, but they have different methods and traditions. The Amish monitor Ho-Chunk activities to ensure that their rituals do not accidentally unleash the very forces both groups are trying to contain.
- **Impact on Watashuka**:  
    The Amish’s covert activities contribute to the strange and sometimes inexplicable phenomena around Watashuka. Their efforts to disrupt cult rituals and protect ley lines have kept the worst of the supernatural forces at bay, though their secrecy has led to rumors and speculation among the townspeople. Their presence plays a critical role in maintaining a delicate balance between the supernatural forces in the region, though few outsiders are aware of the full extent of their involvement.
- **Activities**:
    - **Sabotaging College Research**: The Amish quietly infiltrate Caroline College’s agricultural programs to slow down research that might accidentally tap into the dark forces hidden within the land. They see the college’s experiments as dangerous meddling with forces that are better left undisturbed.
    - **Combating Created Monsters**: The Amish take it upon themselves to destroy the **Dark Young** and other creatures created by the cult of **Shub-Niggurath**. These battles are fought in secret, with the Amish using their knowledge of ancient rituals and herbal remedies to neutralize the monstrosities.
# Amish Protectors
 The Amish in the Watashuka region are covert protectors, using ancient knowledge to defend against supernatural forces. They have a complicated relationship with the Ho-Chunk people and the Lutheran Church, which remains largely unaware of the true threat.
## Overview  
   - The area surrounding Watashuka is home to a large and seemingly traditional Amish population. They are known for their simple, agrarian lifestyle, shunning modern technology and maintaining a close-knit, self-sufficient community. The Amish are generally seen as peaceful and reserved, with little interaction with the broader town beyond necessary trade and commerce.
## **Secret Role:**
  - Unbeknownst to the locals, the Amish presence in the Watashuka region is far from accidental. They are the guardians of an ancient knowledge passed down through generations, tasked with protecting the world from the malevolent forces that others unknowingly or deliberately seek to unleash. The Amish view themselves as the last line of defense against the supernatural entities and dark powers at play in Watashuka.
  - The Amish are particularly focused on countering the efforts of the two warring cults as well as the U.S. government's ongoing operations under **Project Caroline**. They believe these factions are meddling with forces beyond human comprehension, threatening to bring about catastrophic consequences.
  - The Amish see the **Lutheran Church** as potential allies, albeit ones who are largely unaware of the true scale of the supernatural conflict and one who is often misled, fooled or manipulated by forces of evil. Similarly, they have a complicated relationship with the **Ho-Chunk people**, who possess their own ancient knowledge and spiritual practices. While the Amish respect the Ho-Chunk's traditions, they remain cautious, recognizing that the Ho-Chunk have their own goals and methods for dealing with the supernatural.
## **Methods:**
  - The Amish use a combination of ancient rituals, herbal remedies, and a deep understanding of the supernatural to keep the dark forces at bay. Their methods are subtle and often go unnoticed by the untrained eye, appearing as mere traditions or superstitions to outsiders.
  - They have developed a network of hidden safehouses, sanctuaries, and spiritual sites throughout the region, where they conduct their rituals and plan their strategies. These locations are well-guarded, both physically and spiritually, making them difficult for outsiders to discover or infiltrate.
  - The Amish maintain strict secrecy about their true purpose, even among their own community members. Only a select few within the community—those chosen and trained in the ancient ways—are fully aware of the ongoing supernatural battle and their role in it.
## **Interactions with Other Factions:**
  - [[Project Caroline]]: The Amish view the government's continued experiments as reckless and dangerous. While they generally avoid direct confrontation, they work quietly to undermine the government's efforts, using their knowledge of the land and supernatural to disrupt operations.
  - The Cults: The Amish are actively working against the cults, using their own rituals and protective measures to neutralize the cults' influence. They have been known to rescue individuals targeted by the cults, though these actions are always done in secrecy. There primary 'enemy' is the [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]. While [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]] is a concerning group for the Amish, they see [[Shub-Niggurath]] as the bigger threat.
  - [[Lutheran Church]]: While the Lutheran Church is largely unaware of the supernatural dangers lurking in Watashuka, the Amish see them as potential allies. The Amish may occasionally influence church leaders or provide subtle guidance, hoping to strengthen the church's spiritual defenses. However, they also are very aware of how fragile the church is in regard to that defense. The Lutherans are potential allies that are being manipulated into possibly becoming the enemy. 
  - [[Ho-Chunk]] The Amish respect the Ho-Chunk's ancient knowledge and spiritual practices. However, they remain wary, understanding that the Ho-Chunk have their own agenda in dealing with the supernatural. The two groups have an uneasy alliance, cooperating when necessary but keeping their distance otherwise.
## **Impact on Watashuka:**
  - The Amish's covert activities contribute to the strange and sometimes inexplicable phenomena that occur around Watashuka. Their presence, while largely unnoticed by the town’s population, plays a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between the forces at work in the region. They also try to protect the town by offering untainted foods and goods.
  - Their actions also add a layer of mystery and tension to the town's atmosphere, with rumors and whispers circulating about odd occurrences or unexplained events near Amish farms. However, few would suspect the true nature of the Amish’s involvement in the supernatural struggle.

### **Amish Community**
- **Overview**:  
    The Amish in the [[Watashuka]] region are known for their simple, agrarian lifestyle, adhering to traditional values and shunning modern technology. They live in close-knit, self-sufficient communities and are largely seen as peaceful, humble farmers who avoid interacting with the outside world except for essential trade and commerce. To the people of Watashuka, the Amish represent a way of life removed from the complexities of modern society, focused on faith, family, and farming.
- **History in the Region**:  
    The Amish first arrived in the Watashuka region in the late 19th century, following the destruction of **Prairieville Academy** in 1860. Drawn to the fertile farmlands and the opportunity to live a quiet, devout life, the Amish settlers established their community on the outskirts of town. Their migration to the region was seen as part of a broader movement of Amish groups across the Midwest, seeking isolated areas where they could practice their faith and maintain their traditional ways without interference from modern society.
    The Amish quickly became a respected part of the community, known for their hardworking nature and their ability to produce high-quality agricultural goods. Over the years, they have maintained their cultural and religious identity, staying separate from most of Watashuka’s daily life, though their presence at local markets and interactions with the townspeople have remained constant. Their farms, with their iconic horse-drawn buggies and simple wooden houses, have become a familiar sight in the area, adding to the rural character of the region.
    Despite their isolation, the Amish have seen the area change drastically around them, especially with the expansion of **[[Caroline College]]** and the growing influence of modern technology in Watashuka. While they have largely avoided getting involved in the town’s political or social issues, their commitment to their way of life remains steadfast.
- **Public Role**:  
    The Amish are respected by many in Watashuka for their hard work and strong moral principles. They are seen as devout Christians who have little interest in the town’s social or political matters, preferring to remain isolated within their own communities. They maintain a small presence at local markets, where they sell produce, handmade goods, and dairy products to the townspeople. While they are a part of the fabric of Watashuka life, the Amish keep a polite distance from most public affairs, rarely involving themselves in town events or controversies.
- **Traditional Values**:  
    The Amish are known for their emphasis on family, religious devotion, and a lifestyle free from modern conveniences. Their plain clothing, horse-drawn buggies, and lack of electricity make them stand out, but their dedication to their faith earns them the respect of the broader community. They are seen as honest, hardworking people who live simply and avoid the distractions and corruptions of modern life.
- **Public Perception**:  
    While they are generally well-regarded, the Amish are often seen as mysterious by the people of Watashuka. Their strict separation from modern society leads to occasional rumors and misconceptions, with some townspeople viewing them as overly rigid or old-fashioned. However, most interactions with the Amish are positive, and their contributions to the local economy through farming and crafts are appreciated. Their quiet, humble presence adds a sense of rural tranquility to the area.

# The Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled
This cult follows **[[Yog-Sothoth]]**, the Outer God of time, space, and dimensional gates. The cult is focused on manipulating time and summoning eldritch powers. It was founded by **John W. Sterling** after the destruction of Prairieville Academy. They are focused mainly in the science complex, the communications building and the maintenance buildings.
## Activities
### **Manipulating Time Anomalies:**
The cult is attempting to manipulate the time loop to summon [[Yog-Sothoth]] more directly. Their actions could destabilize the loop further, attracting the attention of [[Project Caroline]] and the [[Amish]].
### **Recruiting College Students:**
The cult is targeting students at [[Caroline College]] for recruitment, using promises of power and knowledge. This scheme is monitored by both the [[Lutheran Church]] and Project Caroline operatives, who are quietly attempting to intervene.
### **Gaining Control of the Obelisk:**
The cult of Yog-Sothoth is waiting to gain control over the Obelisk of Nekhbet, believing it to be a key to unlocking their god’s power. This goal brings them into conflict with both the [[Ho-Chunk]] and the Amish. They ultimate goal is to complete a their final ritual to awaken the 'original god'. They believe a key to this ritual involves the Obelisk as well as other structures on campus.
### **Sabotaging Project Caroline:**
The cult is undermining Project Caroline’s efforts to contain supernatural forces, hoping to further their own agenda. However, some factions within Project Caroline may secretly be working with the cult for their own benefit.
### **Influencing Local Politicians:**
The cult is using its influence to control local politics, ensuring that laws and decisions benefit their long-term plans. This manipulation is largely unknown to other factions, though Project Caroline is beginning to suspect.
### **Gathering Forbidden Knowledge:**
The cult is infiltrating libraries, museums, and archives to collect ancient texts and occult knowledge. This puts them at odds with the Ho-Chunk and the Amish, both of whom seek to keep such knowledge hidden or neutralized.
### **Summoning Eldritch Entities:**
The cult is actively trying to summon smaller eldritch entities as part of larger rituals. These attempts often clash with the Amish’s efforts to stop such activities.
### **Targeting Ho-Chunk Leaders:**
The cult is targeting influential members of the Ho-Chunk community, believing them to be obstacles in their plans. This strategy risks igniting open conflict with the Ho-Chunk people.
### **Undermining the Lutheran Church:**
The cult is quietly working to destabilize the Lutheran Church’s influence in town, hoping to weaken its role as a moral and spiritual guide. They have often placed their own cult members in positions of power within the church over the years (see [[The Baptism of '39-Keeper]]).
### **Experimenting with Time Distortions:**
The cult is conducting experiments to manipulate time for their rituals. It is these rituals that caught the attention of the government and was the catalyst for Project Caroline.

# The Church of the Delayed Blossom
This cult venerates **[[Shub-Niggurath]]**, the "Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young." They practice rituals related to fertility and nature, often in twisted, corrupted forms. The cult was founded by **Eleazar Root** after the destruction of the academy.
## Activities
### **Corrupting the Land:**
The cult is using forbidden rituals to corrupt farmland around [[Watashuka]], feeding their god through desecration of the earth. This scheme brings them into conflict with the [[Amish]] and the [[Ho-Chunk]], who are working to purify the land. This work includes manipulation of the food sources in the town (via interference with local grocery stories and food processing facilities), the manipulation of crops and the creation of Dark Young. To this end, the cult has great control over the agricultural and environmental buildings on campus. The Dark Young can be mistaken for trees. These monsters hide in the experimental orchards, farms and environmental preserves around the area. 
### **Creating Hybrid Creatures:**
The cult is experimenting with dark rituals to create hybrid creatures. These experiments take place in both humans and animal experiments. As such the cult has great control over the teaching hospital and the veterinarian school. They have actively worked to ensure that no other medical faculty, human or animal, is allowed in the region. They are actively experimenting on pregnant humans and animals.  
### **Summoning Shub-Niggurath’s Spawn:**
The cult is attempting to summon smaller spawn of Shub-Niggurath, Dark Young, to strengthen their presence in the region. These rituals are often stopped by the Amish or disrupted by the Ho-Chunk people.
### **Sabotaging the Amish:**
The cult is working to undermine the Amish Protectors, trying to discover their hidden safehouses and spiritual sites. This covert war between the two factions is largely unknown to outsiders.
### **Desecrating Sacred Ho-Chunk Sites:**
The cult is actively desecrating Ho-Chunk sacred sites, using these locations to fuel their dark rituals. This creates direct conflict with the Ho-Chunk people, who work to protect these lands. These sacred sites are one of the reasons the two cults do not expand beyond the region.
### **Spreading Influence through Decadence, Health and Family:**
The cult is subtly infiltrating the people of Watashuka via controlling medical facilities, adult entertainment (see [[The Baptism of '39-Keeper]] and reproductive services.
### **Creating Ghasts:**
The cult is actively attempting to perfect a way of creating ghasts from adult, human, males. These monsters could form an expendable army to project the cult's will.

[[Ho-Chunk]]
### **Ho-Chunk Guardians of the Ley Lines (Keeper Entry)**
---
**Overview:**  
The **Ho-Chunk Nation** holds a far more important and secret role in Watashuka than the public realizes. They are the **guardians of the ley lines**—powerful spiritual pathways that crisscross the region, connecting it to other dimensions and realms of existence. The Ho-Chunk have always known the land they inhabit is a place where the veil between worlds is thin, and for centuries they have worked to protect the region from those who seek to manipulate these energies for dark purposes.
Their spiritual practices, rituals, and deep connection to the **spirit world** have allowed them to defend Watashuka from supernatural forces long before European settlers arrived. The Ho-Chunk view themselves as the last line of defense against the eldritch entities that seek to corrupt the land and enter this world through breaches in the ley lines. These **"Hungry Ones"**, as the Ho-Chunk refer to them, are malevolent beings that feed on the energy of the ley lines and pose a threat to all life.
**Beliefs and Role as Guardians:**  
The Ho-Chunk believe the **ley lines** are conduits of spiritual energy that flow between the physical world and the realms of the **Hungry Ones**. Certain points along these lines, known as **"power nodes"**, are places where the veil between worlds is weakest. If left unguarded, these nodes can be used to summon ancient, destructive entities.
- **Rituals of Protection:** The Ho-Chunk perform sacred rituals to maintain the balance of the ley lines. These rituals include **chanting**, the burning of **sacred herbs**, and the drawing of protective **symbols** on the earth. These traditions are passed down through generations of Ho-Chunk shamans, known as **Wąąk Toošewe**, who are responsible for safeguarding the land’s spiritual energy.
- **Communication with Spirits:** The Ho-Chunk have a profound connection to the **spirit world**, and their shamans are able to communicate with the spirits of nature to maintain harmony between the physical and spiritual realms. These spirits help warn the Ho-Chunk of disturbances in the ley lines and assist in protecting the land from supernatural threats.
- **Awareness of Eldritch Forces:** Unlike the general population of Watashuka, the Ho-Chunk have been aware of the **eldritch entities** that threaten the land for centuries. They refer to these beings as the **Hungry Ones**, who were banished from the natural world long ago but seek to return through the ley lines. The Ho-Chunk believe that once the Hungry Ones are allowed into this world, they will consume all life, and preventing their return is the central mission of their spiritual guardianship.
**Relationship with Other Factions:**
- **Amish:** The Ho-Chunk have a tense but cooperative relationship with the **Amish** community, who arrived in the region in the late 19th century. Both groups share a common goal—protecting the land from supernatural threats—but have vastly different methods and beliefs. The two groups have occasionally worked together to stop particularly dangerous rituals but generally keep their distance, each preferring to operate within their own spiritual frameworks.
- **Project Caroline:** The Ho-Chunk view the government’s **Project Caroline** as a reckless intrusion into the spiritual balance of the region. They are particularly concerned with the project’s experiments involving the manipulation of time and space, which they believe have caused significant disruptions in the ley lines. The Ho-Chunk have repeatedly warned government agents about the dangers of their experiments, but their warnings have gone unheeded.
- **Cults:** The Ho-Chunk are well aware of the **Church of the Delayed Blossom** and the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**. Both cults seek to exploit the ley lines for their own dark purposes, and the Ho-Chunk see them as constant threats to the land. They have intervened on several occasions to stop rituals conducted by the cults, though they prefer to remain in the shadows, avoiding direct confrontation unless absolutely necessary.
**Key Figures:**
1. **Chief John Nąąhųc (Tree Bear):**
    - **Role:** The spiritual and community leader of the Ho-Chunk in Watashuka, Chief Nąąhųc is responsible for overseeing the protection of the ley lines and ensuring the balance between the physical and spiritual realms is maintained. He is wise and cautious, preferring to observe the encroaching threats before acting decisively.
2. **Jane Deerwalker:**
    - **Role:** One of the most powerful shamans in the Ho-Chunk Nation, Deerwalker is known for her ability to communicate with the spirits and sense disturbances in the ley lines. She is deeply committed to protecting the land from supernatural forces and is actively involved in countering the time loop created by Project Caroline’s experiments.
3. **Keith Redfeather:**
    - **Role:** A young warrior and apprentice to Deerwalker, Redfeather serves as a scout and protector for the Ho-Chunk. He is highly suspicious of outsiders and is quick to act when he perceives a threat to the land. Though inexperienced, his loyalty to his people and the land drives him to confront those who would harm it.
**Key Locations:**
- **Grove of the Two Trees:** A sacred ley line node protected by the Ho-Chunk, where ancient rituals are performed to keep the balance between worlds. The **Church of the Delayed Blossom** has repeatedly attempted to corrupt this site, but the Ho-Chunk have successfully defended it each time.
- **Caves of Lake Mary:** Believed to be a gateway to the spirit world, these caves are guarded by the Ho-Chunk and are considered one of the most important spiritual sites in the region. The caves hold ancient carvings that map the ley lines and warn of the **Hungry Ones**.
**Current Threats:**
- **Project Caroline’s Time Loop:** The Ho-Chunk are deeply concerned with the time loop created by **Dr. Amy Mann**’s experiments. They believe this loop has thrown the ley lines out of balance and threatens to weaken the barriers between worlds, making it easier for the **Hungry Ones** to return.
- **Cults of Watashuka:** The Ho-Chunk are constantly monitoring the activities of the **Church of the Delayed Blossom** and the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, whose rituals could open breaches in the ley lines, allowing ancient entities to enter the physical world.
**Activities:**
- **Protecting Sacred Sites:** The Ho-Chunk work quietly to protect their sacred sites from exploitation by the government and the cults. They conduct regular rituals to maintain the spiritual balance and prevent the ley lines from being corrupted.
- **Neutralizing Cult Rituals:** The Ho-Chunk are actively working to disrupt the rituals of the cults operating in Watashuka, using their spiritual knowledge to neutralize dark powers before they can take root.
# **Ho-Chunk Guardians of the Ley Lines**
(_The Silent Protectors of Watashuka’s Ancient Power_)
## **Overview**:  
The **Ho-Chunk Nation**, also known as the **People of the Sacred Voice**, have lived on the land surrounding Watashuka for centuries, long before European settlers arrived. Deeply connected to the natural world and the spiritual energies that flow through the earth, the Ho-Chunk are the ancient protectors of the region’s **ley lines**—the powerful, invisible pathways that connect the land to the **supernatural realms**.
The Ho-Chunk have always known that the land they call home is special, a place where the boundaries between worlds are thinner, and where spiritual energy pools in certain sacred sites. These ley lines are both a blessing and a curse, offering great power but also attracting dark forces that seek to exploit them. The Ho-Chunk’s traditional role has been to guard these sites, using their spiritual knowledge and rituals to protect the land from those who would misuse its power—whether they be human or something far older and more dangerous.
Though their numbers have dwindled, the Ho-Chunk continue to fulfill this ancient duty, even in the face of growing threats from government projects, local cults, and the encroaching modern world.
## **Beliefs and Role as Guardians**:
The Ho-Chunk believe that the **ley lines** are pathways that connect the natural world to the **spiritual realms**, channels through which energy flows between different dimensions. Certain points along these lines, known as **"power nodes,"** are places where the veil between worlds is thinnest, and where great spiritual power can be harnessed—either for good or ill.
For the Ho-Chunk, these sites are sacred. They see themselves as the appointed guardians of the land, responsible for maintaining the balance between the natural and supernatural worlds. Their role is to ensure that the ley lines remain undisturbed, and that the **ancient entities** that dwell beyond the veil are not summoned or awakened.
- **Rituals of Protection**: The Ho-Chunk use **rituals** passed down through generations to safeguard the ley lines. These rituals involve chanting, the use of **sacred herbs**, and the drawing of protective **symbols** on the earth. The Ho-Chunk know that certain rituals must be performed regularly to keep the ley lines in balance, preventing any one group from harnessing too much of their power.
- **Communication with Spirits**: The Ho-Chunk maintain a deep connection to the **spirit world**. Their shamans, known as **"Wąąk Toošewe,"** act as intermediaries between the human world and the spirits of the land. These shamans can sense disturbances in the ley lines and are able to communicate with the **spirits of nature** to help keep the land protected.
- **Eldritch Awareness**: Unlike the local settlers, who only recently discovered the dangers of the **eldritch forces** lurking beneath Watashuka, the Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the presence of these beings. They refer to these ancient entities as **"the [[Hungry Ones]]"**, spirits who were banished from the natural world long ago and now seek to return through breaches in the ley lines. The Ho-Chunk believe that once the Hungry Ones are allowed into this world, they will consume all life, and their return must be prevented at all costs.
---
## **Relationship with the Amish**:
Though the Ho-Chunk and the [[Amish]] come from vastly different cultural backgrounds, they have shared a common purpose since the late **19th century**: the protection of the land from **supernatural threats**. The alliance between the two groups was born out of necessity in the **1890s**, when a failed ritual by [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] nearly brought an **eldritch entity** into the world.
- **The Alliance**: At first, the Amish and the Ho-Chunk were wary of one another. The Amish, with their Christian beliefs, were initially suspicious of the Ho-Chunk’s spiritual practices, while the Ho-Chunk saw the Amish as outsiders who did not understand the land’s deeper significance. However, after the **Blizzard of 1888**, the two groups found common ground in their shared desire to protect the land from the forces that sought to corrupt it. Though the alliance is largely unspoken, both groups respect one another and often work together in secret to combat threats to the ley lines.
- **Maintaining Distance**: Despite their cooperation, the Ho-Chunk and Amish maintain separate spheres of influence. The Ho-Chunk focus on the **ley lines** and **sacred sites**, while the Amish use their **herbal magic** and **symbolic protections** to guard their farmlands and the surrounding area. The two groups communicate infrequently, but when major disturbances occur, they come together to combine their knowledge and abilities.
## **Recent Conflicts**:
### **Government Encroachment (1930s-Present)**:  
The Ho-Chunk have become increasingly concerned with the **U.S. government’s** activities in the region, particularly the founding of [[Project Caroline]] in the 1940s. Though the government claims its experiments are purely scientific, the Ho-Chunk know that the government is tampering with forces beyond their control, disturbing the ley lines in dangerous ways. The Ho-Chunk elders have issued warnings to the local authorities, but these have been ignored or dismissed as superstitious nonsense.
### Shamanic Observations:
The Ho-Chunk shamans have noted strange fluctuations in the ley lines ever since [[Amy Mann|Dr. Amy Mann]] experiments in the early 1980s. They believe that the creation of the **time loop** in 1983 is a direct result of the government’s meddling with the ley lines, and they have been working tirelessly to find a way to break the loop and restore balance to the land.
### **Cults of Watashuka**:  
The Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the two rival cults operating in Watashuka. Both cults seek to exploit the ley lines for their own dark purposes, and the Ho-Chunk view them as a constant threat. 
- [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]: The Ho-Chunk see the **Church of the Delayed Blossom**, followers of [[Shub-Niggurath]], as dangerous because of their focus on corrupting the natural world. The church’s fertility rituals threaten to warp the land, and the Ho-Chunk have intervened on numerous occasions to stop these rituals before they could come to fruition.
- [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]: The Ho-Chunk are more wary the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**, whose experiments with time manipulation could have catastrophic consequences for the entire region, the world or even the universe. The Brotherhood’s attempts to create rifts in time threaten to unravel the fabric of reality, and the Ho-Chunk have dedicated themselves to preventing these rituals from succeeding.
### **Key Ho-Chunk Figures**:
1. **Chief John Nąąhųc (Tree Bear)**:
    - **Role**: The current leader of the Ho-Chunk in the Watashuka region, Chief John Nąąhųc is a respected elder who has guided his people through many hardships. He is deeply connected to the spiritual forces of the land and takes his role as guardian of the ley lines very seriously. Nąąhųc is stoic and cautious, believing that the best way to protect the land is through quiet vigilance and careful intervention. He has worked closely with the Amish when necessary but prefers to keep his people out of the town’s politics. He is known for his love of Dr. Pepper.
2. **Jane Deerwalker**:
    - **Role**: One of the most powerful **Wąąk Toošewe** (shamans) in the Ho-Chunk community, Jane Deerwalker is responsible for maintaining the spiritual balance of the ley lines. She has the ability to sense disturbances in the spiritual realm and often serves as the first line of defense when the cults or government experiments cause disruptions. Jane is known for her wisdom and is often consulted by Chief Nąąhųc on matters related to the supernatural. She is particularly wary of the time loop created by Dr. Amy Mann and has been working on a way to counteract its effects.
3. **Ketih Redfeather**:
    - **Role**: A young Ho-Chunk warrior and apprentice to Deerwalker, Keith Redfeather is fiercely protective of his people and the land. He often serves as a scout, keeping an eye on the activities of both the cults and the government. Though he lacks the spiritual experience of his elders, Keith is brave and quick to act, often clashing with his more cautious superiors. He is deeply suspicious of outsiders and is particularly hostile toward Project Caroline, seeing it as a direct threat to the ley lines.
---
## **Key Locations**:
### **Grove of the Two Trees**:
This **sacred site** is a powerful ley line node where two ancient oak trees stand, their roots intertwined in a way that suggests they have grown together for centuries. The Ho-Chunk believe this grove is one of the most important power points in the region and perform regular rituals here to maintain balance. [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] has attempted to use this site for mutation rituals, but the Ho-Chunk have successfully defended it each time.
### **The Caves of Lake Mary**:
These caves, located near Lake Mary, are believed to be an entry point to the spirit world. The Ho-Chunk used to use the caves for their most sacred ceremonies before the events of [[The Baptism of '39-Keeper]]. Now only **Wąąk Toošewe** are allowed to enter. The caves are said to contain **ancient carvings** that map the ley lines and predict the coming of the Hungry Ones if the ley lines are ever fully corrupted.
## **Legacy**:  
The Ho-Chunk’s presence in Watashuka has been largely overshadowed by the town’s more visible history, but their role as guardians of the ley lines remains vital. In a town filled with hidden dangers—government conspiracies, warring cults, and supernatural entities—the Ho-Chunk continue to protect the balance, often without recognition or thanks. Their vigilance is all that stands between the land and the ancient forces that seek to consume it.
## Activities
### **Preserving Sacred Sites:**
The Ho-Chunk are quietly protecting their sacred sites from government and cult interference. This effort puts them at odds with Project Caroline, which is conducting experiments on or near these locations.
### **Sharing Knowledge with the Amish:**
Some members of the Ho-Chunk are working with the Amish to exchange ancient knowledge. This uneasy alliance is based on mutual respect but could fall apart if trust is broken.
### **Break the Time Loop:**
Elders of the tribe have detected the time loop and attempt to either break the loop or at least pass knowledge from loop to the next. 
### **Combating Created Monsters:**
The Ho-Chunk attempt to destroy the monstrosities that the cult create.
### **Sabotaging Cult Rituals:**
The Ho-Chunk are actively working to disrupt the cult rituals, particularly those that desecrate the land. They may use their spiritual knowledge to neutralize dark powers, unknowingly aligning with the Amish in these efforts.
### **Advising Caroline College Faculty:**
Certain Ho-Chunk leaders are offering subtle guidance to faculty at Caroline College, steering them away from research paths that might inadvertently lead to supernatural dangers. This puts them in quiet conflict with Project Caroline operatives.
### **Fostering Cultural Awareness:**
The Ho-Chunk people are working to promote cultural awareness through the Ho-Chunk Cultural Heritage Museum, hoping to protect their traditions from external influences. This brings them into indirect conflict with Project Caroline’s attempts to exploit their knowledge. It is through this awareness that the tribe hopes to pass knowledge from one time loop to the next. They make use of the various museums and heritage centers in the region for this.
### **Monitoring Project Caroline:**
The Ho-Chunk are aware of the government attempts to make use of eldritch magic. They are actively attempting to stop this exploitation as they believe that the government does not understand the dangers they are putting every at risk of.
### **Neutralizing Government Technology:**
The Ho-Chunk are using their spiritual practices to subtly interfere with government surveillance and experiments, particularly in areas they deem sacred.
### **Guarding Against Yog-Sothoth Followers:**
The Ho-Chunk are closely watching the cult of Yog-Sothoth, believing that their summoning rituals could unleash devastating forces. They are actively working to stop these rituals but may come into conflict with the Amish over methods and intentions.

# **Ho-Chunk People**
**Overview:**  
The **Ho-Chunk Nation**, also known as the **People of the Sacred Voice**, are the original inhabitants of the land surrounding [[Watashuka]]. Their ancestors have lived in the region for centuries, long before European settlers arrived. The Ho-Chunk have a deep connection to the land, its natural resources, and its spiritual significance. Though their population has diminished over time, the Ho-Chunk remain an integral part of the region’s cultural and historical landscape.
**Cultural Significance:**  
The Ho-Chunk people have long believed that the land around Watashuka is sacred. Their traditions emphasize harmony with nature, and they hold regular ceremonies to honor the spirits of the earth. For generations, they have passed down their knowledge of the land’s unique spiritual energy, teaching that certain locations are sites of great power. These beliefs continue to influence the Ho-Chunk’s way of life, as they strive to preserve their cultural heritage and protect the land from further exploitation.
**Community and Economy:**  
In modern times, the Ho-Chunk maintain a presence in the region through their **cultural centers** and participation in local events. They are known for producing traditional crafts, offering educational programs on Ho-Chunk history, and organizing cultural festivals that attract visitors from surrounding areas. The Ho-Chunk people also operate businesses in and around Watashuka, including agriculture and tourism, which provide them with economic stability while preserving their connection to the land.
**Challenges:**  
The Ho-Chunk community, like many Indigenous groups, faces ongoing challenges related to land rights, cultural preservation, and the encroachment of modern society. Government projects, such as the construction of **[[Caroline College]]** and various agricultural developments, have threatened Ho-Chunk sacred sites over the years. Despite these challenges, the Ho-Chunk remain resilient, working to protect their traditions while engaging with local and state authorities to ensure that their voice is heard in decisions impacting the region.
**Cultural Preservation:**  
The **Ho-Chunk Cultural Heritage Museum** in Watashuka serves as a focal point for preserving and sharing their history. It offers exhibits on traditional Ho-Chunk life, artifacts from the past, and explanations of their spiritual beliefs, providing both locals and visitors with an opportunity to learn about their culture. Educational programs are also offered to local schools, helping to ensure that future generations understand the importance of the Ho-Chunk people’s connection to the land.

[[Lutheran Church]]
- **Role in the Occult**: Unbeknownst to the church, several members of the leadership are either cultists themselves or have been unknowingly influenced by cult activities. Cults like [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]] have long infiltrated the institution, manipulating church decisions while keeping the clergy and congregation oblivious to the deeper supernatural forces at work.
- **Exorcisms**: While the church believes it is expelling demons, many of these rituals are targeting individuals affected by real occult influences—sometimes with unintended consequences. In some cases, their exorcisms have accidentally interfered with cult rituals or triggered retaliatory actions from occult groups operating in [[Watashuka]].
- **Engaging the Amish**: Certain clergy have quietly reached out to the [[Amish-Keeper]] for guidance, sensing that the Amish know more about the spiritual disturbances in town than they let on. The Amish, in turn, see the Lutheran Church as a potential ally but remain wary, given the church’s naiveté regarding the true scale of the supernatural threats.
- **Necromantic Influence**: The church maintains the cemetery near Lake View, unaware that it is a hotspot for cultists attempting necromantic rituals. While pastors bless the grounds and offer prayers to protect it, the cemetery remains a contested site between cults and the Amish, both of whom seek to control its mystical power.
- **Dangerous Charity Intersections**: The church’s charity events, while well-intentioned, have at times crossed paths with occult activities. Amish safehouses and rituals occasionally coincide with these events, leading to tension. The church is unaware of these clashes but continues to unknowingly involve itself in supernatural matters.
- **Internal Corruption**: While some pastors genuinely work to protect the congregation, others have unknowingly facilitated cult activities by offering sanctuary to cultists posing as victims. The cultists manipulate the church’s goodwill to hide their true intentions.

# Lutheran Church
- **Role**: The Lutheran Church represents the largest religious institution in [[Watashuka]] and is seen as a stabilizing force in the community. With half of the town’s population attending services, the church plays a crucial role in maintaining the spiritual and moral framework of the town. The congregation is unaware of any real supernatural forces at work and believes their primary concern is protecting the town from ‘devil worshipers’ and cultural shifts infiltrating the college and community.
- **History**: The Lutheran Church’s influence in Watashuka dates back to the **[[Great Influx]]** following the [[Blizzard of 1888]], when large numbers of Lutheran settlers arrived in the region to offer humanitarian aid. Many of these settlers were recent immigrants from Germany, and after helping the region recover from the devastating storm, they decided to make Watashuka their home. Their arrival significantly shaped the town’s religious and cultural identity, as they established churches, schools, and community centers that reflected their Lutheran values. Over time, the church grew to become the dominant religious institution in the area, cementing its place as a cornerstone of Watashuka's life.
- **Community Involvement**: The church is actively involved in organizing charity events, supporting local families, and fostering engagement with youth. They are also quietly helping protect the community, providing sanctuary to troubled individuals and maintaining the town’s cemetery with a sense of reverence. Their work has helped maintain a strong moral foundation in Watashuka, particularly as the town faces economic decline.
- **Protecting Congregants**: The church leadership has noticed strange behavior among some congregants and is taking steps to protect the flock from potential outside influences, including what they perceive as destructive and unholy. Pastors occasionally perform exorcisms, trying to rid people of what they believe are signs of demonic possession. In each case, those subject to possession all share two common traits; heavy metal music and role-playing games.
- **Supporting the Watashuka Initiative**: Some church leaders previously supported the [[Watashuka Initiative]], a government project designed to bring economic and technological development to the region, officially ending in 1969. They believed it was beneficial to the community and even offered prayers for its success. However, with the initiative's end, the church has continued to focus on local outreach, charity efforts, and new government initiatives being considered.
- **Engaging with the Ho-Chunk**: In recent years, some members of the Lutheran Church have cautiously engaged with the local [[Ho-Chunk]] people, seeking to understand their traditions. These interactions are seen as efforts to foster cross-cultural respect, though some view these efforts with suspicion.

[[Metalheads]]
# **The Metalheads (Local Counterculture and Occult Fighters)**
## **Overview**: 
In the early 1980s, Watashuka’s _Metalhead_ community is a tight-knit group of teenagers and young adults who rally around heavy metal music, tabletop role-playing games, and the rebellion of youth counterculture. What makes them unique in Watashuka is their hidden role as one of the few groups actively fighting against the occult forces that threaten the town. Unlike the stereotypes of the time, which painted them as devil-worshipping delinquents, these outcasts use their knowledge of obscure lore, occult symbols, and music to resist eldritch forces, often working in the shadows to prevent horrors that most townspeople never see.
## **Role in Town**: 
Viewed with suspicion and disdain by the more conservative residents of Watashuka, the _Metalheads_ are frequently blamed for vandalism, strange disappearances, and even weather anomalies. Their loud music, punk rock attire, and unconventional interests make them easy targets for the [[Mothers Opposing Metal]] group, the town’s moral watchdogs. However, behind their rebellious exterior, they are actually one of the few factions in Watashuka actively working to combat the cults and dark powers manipulating the town.
## **Base of Operations**: 
Many of the _Metalheads_ hang out at _Jack’s Surfer: Comics & Games_ or at the _Blue Heron Pub_. This group is heavily influenced by metal music’s cryptic lyrics and the imagery of fantasy role-playing games like _Dungeons & Dragons_, which have inadvertently led them to discover real occult knowledge hidden within the town's dark history.
## **Notable Figures**:
- **“Raven” Becky Thompson**: One of the few female Metalheads in town, Becky is fiercely independent and well-versed in occult symbols and esoteric rituals. She spends her days researching local folklore at _The Prince: New & Used Books_ and her nights planning counter-attacks against the cultists, using her knowledge of heavy metal and mythology.
- **Eddie “Styx” Delano**: Eddie is the town’s go-to guy for rituals that require certain "artifacts" like skulls, daggers, and ritual books. He’s resourceful, knowing how to procure these items without raising suspicion. Despite his rough appearance, Eddie is serious about fighting the occult forces, and he has a strong moral code, believing they must protect the innocent from the eldritch horrors lurking in the town.
## **Activities**:
- **Occult Research**: The Metalheads spend much of their time researching occult symbols and rituals that can be found in their music and games, giving them an edge when it comes to identifying cult activity.
- **Disrupting Rituals**: They've made it their mission to disrupt local cults by graffitiing occult symbols that interfere with rituals, performing counter-rituals themselves, and even engaging in direct action when necessary.
- **Underground Communication**: Using [[Dave|Dave's]] radio show, the Metalheads pass coded messages to each other about cult movements and activities.
- **Public Perception**: Feared and misunderstood by the general populace, the _Metalheads_ are often accused of satanic rituals themselves, especially by the _Mothers Opposing Metal_ (MOM) group. Their music and games are seen as gateways to evil, even though the reality is that they are often the ones standing between the town and much darker forces.

**MOTHERS OPPOSING METAL**  
_Defending Watashuka’s Morals and Protecting Our Children_  
**September 1983 Special Edition: The Metalhead Threat Escalates!**
---
**Dear Concerned Parents and Members of the [[Watashuka]] Community,**
We write to you today with the utmost urgency regarding a disturbing and dangerous trend that has emerged in our beloved town. As you know, our mission in **[[Mothers Opposing Metal|Mothers Opposing Metal (MOM)]]** has always been to protect the innocence of our children and safeguard our community from the ever-present threat of Satanic influence. It is with great sadness and alarm that we must report on a new development in the alarming behaviors of the so-called "Metalheads" in our midst.
We have long been aware of the corrupting influence of **heavy metal music** and **role-playing games**, but recent events have revealed that these youths—already steeped in the glorification of violence, Satanism, and rebellion—are now engaging in criminal activity. Their actions are more than just a public nuisance; they represent a grave danger to our children, our families, and our way of life.
---
### **Metalheads Target Local Children: Reports of Kidnapping in Mackie Recreational Park!**
It has come to our attention that children in **Mackie Recreational Park** have been approached and, in some cases, lured away by members of the **Metalhead subculture**. These individuals, easily identifiable by their long hair, black leather jackets, and offensive band logos, have been seen loitering near the playgrounds and picnic areas, targeting our most vulnerable. **Multiple concerned parents** have reported strange behavior from these Metalheads, who reportedly entice children with promises of "fun" and "games," only to disappear with them into the wooded areas surrounding the park. Parents tell us that their children were abused, forced to bless Satan, and then hypnotized to forget the event.
Although no children have *officially* been reported missing yet, we believe this is only the beginning. The **Watashuka Police Department** has been notified, and we urge all parents to keep a close watch on their children, especially as Halloween approaches—a time when these devil-worshiping youths are known to celebrate their twisted rituals. **We believe the Metalheads are using role-playing games as a way to indoctrinate children into their dark world,** encouraging them to escape reality and immerse themselves in dangerous fantasies of occult power and rebellion.
---
### **Satanic Rituals and Stolen Farm Animals: A New Horror on the Outskirts**
Disturbingly, we have also received **multiple reports from local farmers** who have found their livestock missing or mutilated in recent weeks. It is no coincidence that these incidents coincide with an increase in Metalhead activity in the area. Eyewitness accounts describe groups of these Metalheads gathering near remote barns and abandoned buildings late at night, playing their demonic music at high volumes and conducting what can only be described as **ritualistic ceremonies**.
Our sources indicate that the **Metalheads are using these stolen animals in Satanic rituals,** mimicking the horrific sacrifices described in their heavy metal lyrics and the darkest of their role-playing games. These games, which often feature blood magic, demon-summoning, and the sacrifice of innocent creatures, have desensitized these youths to real-life violence and depravity. **What starts as a game can easily become reality**, and the lines between fantasy and real-life horror are quickly disappearing for those trapped in this lifestyle.
---
### **How You Can Protect Your Children and Our Community:**
We urge all parents and concerned citizens to take the following steps to protect our town from the influence of the Metalheads:
1. **Stay Vigilant in Public Spaces:** Do not allow your children to wander alone in parks or public areas, especially after dark. The Metalheads are known to operate under the cover of night.
2. **Monitor Your Children’s Activities:** Keep a close eye on the music your children are listening to and the games they are playing. If you see any signs of involvement with heavy metal music or role-playing games, intervene immediately.
3. **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you see Metalheads congregating near schools, parks, or your neighborhood, do not hesitate to contact the police. Together, we can put an end to their criminal activity.
4. **Spread the Word:** Share this newsletter with your friends and neighbors. The more people are aware of the Metalhead threat, the better we can defend our community.
5. **Attend Our Next Meeting:** Join us at **All Saints Lutheran Church** this Friday evening for a special prayer service and strategy session on how we can continue to fight back against these dark influences. We must show these Metalheads that our community will not stand for their wicked behavior!
---
### **Closing Thoughts:**
Remember, fellow mothers and fathers, we stand on the front lines in the battle for our children’s souls. The threat posed by these Metalheads is real and growing. Their music, their games, and their lifestyle glorify Satanic rituals and violent rebellion. **We cannot let this evil take root in Watashuka.**
Let us continue to pray for our town, for our children, and for the courage to stand strong in the face of darkness. Together, we will protect Watashuka from the corruption that seeks to destroy it.
**With steadfast resolve,**  
**Nancy Mueller**  
President, Mothers Opposing Metal
---
**Remember:** **Our children are watching. Our future depends on us.**

[[Mothers Opposing Metal]]
- **Overview**:  
    MOM is a well-meaning but misguided group whose focus on fighting metal music, role-playing games, and youth rebellion has blinded them to the real occult forces at work in [[Watashuka]]. Their obsession with the so-called "satanic panic" distracts them from the true dangers posed by the cults secretly operating within the town. While MOM believes they are protecting the youth, their efforts unintentionally shield the activities of groups like the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]** and the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]**, who continue their dark rituals without interference.
- **Unintentional Harm**:  
    MOM’s fixation on superficial symbols of rebellion—like metal music and games—has created a climate of paranoia in Watashuka, leading to increased tensions between the town’s youth and its more conservative residents. By focusing on scapegoats like the Metalheads, MOM misses the true threats posed by the town’s occult factions. This allows the cults to operate more freely, as the town’s resources are directed towards suppressing harmless expressions of youth culture rather than investigating the real supernatural dangers.
- **Blind to the Occult**:  
    Despite their belief that they are combating satanic forces, MOM is completely unaware of the true occult activity happening under their noses. The real cults in town manipulate the situation to their advantage, allowing MOM to distract the public from their own activities. While MOM views the Metalheads as a dangerous subculture, it is the cults entrenched in the town’s institutions that pose the true threat to Watashuka.
- **Key Figures (Keeper Secrets)**:
    - **Nancy Mueller**: Though Nancy believes wholeheartedly in her cause, she is completely blind to the true supernatural dangers that surround her. Her influence over local politics and the church has allowed her to successfully push forward many of MOM’s agendas, but her efforts inadvertently create cover for the cults operating within the town.
    - **Sandra Pike**: Sandra is passionate about fighting against what she sees as moral decay, but her zeal often causes her to overlook the real danger. She is quick to lead rallies and protests, which further divide the community, allowing the cults to continue operating in the shadows.
    - **Karen Albright**: Karen’s personal vendetta against the Metalheads, fueled by her estranged relationship with her son, makes her one of MOM’s most active members. She often oversteps, spying on teenagers and pressuring local authorities to act on any suspicion, further increasing tensions between the youth and the town’s leadership.
- **Impact on the Town**:  
    While MOM’s actions may seem harmless on the surface, they create a tense atmosphere in Watashuka, especially for the town’s youth. This tension allows the real supernatural dangers to thrive, as the cults and dark forces at work in the town are able to operate unchecked while the public is distracted by MOM’s moral crusade.
- **Potential Hooks for Investigators**:
    - **Misguided Crusade**: Investigators may find themselves at odds with MOM, especially if they are seen as part of the youth counterculture or are involved in activities that MOM deems suspicious. They may need to navigate the group’s influence or convince them of the real dangers at play.
    - **Unwitting Allies**: Investigators could use MOM’s influence in the town to their advantage by redirecting their focus towards the real occult threats. However, MOM’s members are deeply entrenched in their beliefs, making this a difficult task.
    - **Source of Tension**: MOM’s actions create tension within the town, which investigators may need to exploit or navigate to further their own investigations. MOM’s public influence makes them a powerful force, but their focus on the wrong issues makes them both a hindrance and a potential asset if manipulated correctly.
# **MOM: Mothers Opposing Metal (Moral Watchdogs and Anti-Occult Activists)**
## **Overview**: 
_Mothers Opposing Metal_ (MOM) is a group of highly conservative mothers, fathers and community members in Watashuka who believe that heavy metal music, role-playing games, and anything associated with counterculture is a gateway to devil worship and societal decay. Founded in response to the rising popularity of metal music and games like _Dungeons & Dragons_, MOM is determined to root out what they see as the growing influence of the occult, often targeting the [[Metalheads]] and their associated subculture as the prime instigators of evil in the town.
## **Role in Town**: 
MOM holds considerable sway over local politics, religious organizations, and the school system. They have pressured the Lutheran Church, the school board, and local law enforcement to crack down on anything they perceive as occult-related, from album covers to role-playing game paraphernalia. However, unbeknownst to them, their crusade against the _Metalheads_ distracts the town from the real supernatural threats: the secretive cults embedded in Watashuka’s institutions.
## **Base of Operations**: 
The group typically meets at _All Saints Lutheran Church_ or in the living rooms of its more prominent members. These meetings are filled with prayer, discussion of moral purity, and planning sessions to counteract what they see as the satanic influences in town. MOM often organizes public events, like anti-metal rallies, book burnings, and community outreach to "save" the youth.
## **Notable Figures**:
- **Nancy Mueller** (Leader): Nancy is the founder and driving force behind MOM. The wife of Pastor Daniel Mueller of All Saints Lutheran Church, she sees herself as the moral compass of the town. Nancy is deeply religious and believes that Watashuka’s problems stem from allowing corrupting influences like metal music and role-playing games into the community. Though she has good intentions, Nancy is blind to the real evil lurking beneath the surface.
- **Sandra Pike**: Sandra is Nancy’s right-hand woman and an expert at mobilizing local parents to join their cause. A fiery speaker, she often leads public demonstrations against the _Metalheads_ and has a reputation for stirring up fear among the townspeople.
- **Karen Albright**: A zealous member of MOM, Karen is obsessed with monitoring the actions of the _Metalheads_. Her son, who is secretly part of the Metalhead group, has been estranged from her, which fuels her crusade to save other children from the "satanic influences."
## **Activities**:   
- **Public Demonstrations**: MOM holds rallies and prayer vigils in protest of concerts, game nights at _Jack’s Surfer_, and other events associated with the Metalhead community. These events are often loud and gain significant attention from the local media.
- **Moral Crusades**: MOM has successfully pressured local authorities to raid _Jack’s Surfer_ and confiscate game books, music records, and other materials they deem "satanic." They’ve also convinced the school board to ban certain music and literature from the high school, labeling it as dangerous to the youth.
- **Surveillance of Youth**: Members of MOM are notorious for keeping a close eye on their children's activities. They often spy on local teenagers, monitoring their music and friendships, and report any "suspicious" behavior to local authorities.
- **Public Perception**: While they are respected by many of the older and more religious townspeople, MOM is also seen as overbearing and alarmist by younger generations. The _Metalheads_ and other teens view them as clueless moralists who don’t understand the real dangers lurking in Watashuka. Their activities often lead to unnecessary distractions, allowing the true occult forces to operate unchecked.
## **Unintentional Harm**: 
By focusing on the _Metalheads_ and other harmless expressions of youth rebellion, MOM misses the real threat posed by the cults in town. Their obsession with the _Satanic Panic_ creates an atmosphere of paranoia that allows the true cults—like [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] and [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]—to continue their dark rituals without interference.

# **Mothers Opposing Metal (MOM)**
- **Overview**:  
    _Mothers Opposing Metal_ (MOM) is a highly vocal, conservative group based in [[Watashuka]], comprised of concerned mothers, fathers, and other community members who believe that heavy metal music, role-playing games, and youth counterculture are gateways to devil worship and societal decay. Founded in response to the growing popularity of metal music and games like _Dungeons & Dragons_, MOM seeks to protect the town’s youth from what they perceive as occult influences, primarily targeting the local **Metalheads** and their culture.
- **Role in Town**:  
    MOM has a strong influence over local politics, religious organizations, and the school system. Their efforts are centered on pressuring the **Lutheran Church**, the school board, and law enforcement to crack down on what they see as "satanic" influences in the town. Their public demonstrations, prayer vigils, and moral crusades often succeed in getting certain music, books, and games banned from schools and public spaces.
- **Base of Operations**:  
    MOM holds regular meetings at **All Saints Lutheran Church**, where its members gather for prayer, discussion of moral values, and the planning of public demonstrations. They also meet in the living rooms of prominent members for smaller organizing sessions. These gatherings are focused on protecting the youth and ridding the town of what they see as satanic influences.
- **Notable Figures**:
    - **Nancy Mueller** (Leader): Nancy is the founder of MOM and the wife of **Pastor Daniel Mueller**. She believes that Watashuka’s moral decay is a result of allowing corrupt influences like metal music and role-playing games to take root in the community. Nancy is deeply religious and sees herself as the moral protector of the town.
    - **Sandra Pike**: Sandra is Nancy’s second-in-command, known for her fiery speeches and ability to mobilize the group’s members. She often leads public rallies and demonstrations against the [[Metalheads|metalhead]] culture.
    - **Karen Albright**: A zealous member of MOM, Karen is obsessed with monitoring the actions of the local [[Metalheads]], particularly because her own son has secretly joined the group. Her personal vendetta fuels much of her crusade.

    - **Surveillance of Youth**: MOM members keep a close eye on the town’s teenagers, monitoring their activities and friendships. They report any "suspicious" behavior—such as listening to metal music or playing role-playing games—to local authorities, often resulting in unwarranted crackdowns on harmless teenage rebellion.
- **Public Perception**:  
    MOM is respected by many of the older, more religious townspeople, who see the group as a moral force protecting the town from corruption. However, younger generations—particularly the Metalheads—view them as overbearing and out of touch with reality. While they succeed in banning certain materials, many see their activities as distractions from more serious issues.

# Project Caroline
A covert operation using Caroline College as a front to investigate supernatural phenomena. Agents are embedded throughout the town.
[[Watashuka Initiative]] was a cover for the Project Caroline project. Through leaks, the community began to assume the two were the same. No effort were made to correct this so that future obfuscation would be easier. 
## Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)
The original founding group of Project Caroline. It was founded as a result of investigating [[The Baptism of '39]] **Agent Howard Fitzsimmons** was the first investigator, and later founder, of the project
 ## Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)
- The Office of Technology Assessment took over Project Caroline from the OSRD upon its restart in the mid 70's. The OTA continues to operate covertly, with **Dr. Amy Mann** being one of their key assets. The project involves time manipulation, which has inadvertently created a **time loop** from 1983 to 1987.
## The Time Loop and Project Caroline
### **Time Loop (1983-1987)**
- **Overview:** Due to the experiments conducted by **Dr. Amy Mann** under **Project Caroline**, the universe has become trapped in a time loop spanning from 1983 to 1987. The only way to escape the loop is to rescue Amy Mann, who disappears at the beginning of each loop.
### **Project Caroline**
- **Overview:** A secret government initiative that started during WWII and continues in secret today, overseen by the **OTA**. The project is focused on studying and controlling supernatural phenomena, particularly time manipulation, with the aim of replicating the abilities of eldritch gods. Many at Caroline College are unaware that the project is still active.
# Possible Faction Schemes
### **U.S. Government (Project Caroline)**
1. **Time Loop Experiments:**
    - Project Caroline is continuing time manipulation experiments, hoping to find a way to control the time by exploiting eldritch energy. Their actions attract the attention of the Amish and cultists, who either try to stop or exploit these experiments.
2. **Surveillance of the Amish:**
    - Government agents have begun covertly surveilling the Amish community, suspecting them of harboring knowledge of the supernatural forces at play. This scheme risks tipping off the Amish to the government’s deeper involvement.
3. **Infiltrating Caroline College:**
    - Project Caroline has placed covert operatives among the faculty and students of Caroline College to monitor and influence ongoing supernatural events. These agents are particularly interested in the activities of the cults, activities at campus location that defy traditional surveillance technology, and any Amish involvement on campus.
4. **Weaponizing Supernatural Forces:**
    - The government is experimenting with using eldritch entities and powers as weapons. These efforts occasionally intersect with the cults, who seek to manipulate these same forces for their own ends.
5. **Studying the Buildings:**
    - Project Caroline is researching select buildings their potential ties to ancient powers. This research draws the attention of both cults, who have constructed or obtain the structures over the decades.
6. **Suppressing Cult Activity:**
    - The government is secretly tracking and eliminating high-ranking members of both the [[Yog-Sothoth]] and [[Shub-Niggurath]] cults. However, the cults are becoming aware of this effort and are striking back through more covert means.
7. **Containment of Eldritch Entities:**
    - Project Caroline is working on containment procedures for the eldritch beings they have encountered. Their containment methods often conflict with the Ho-Chunk and Amish’s own rituals to banish or neutralize these entities.
8. **Manipulating Ho-Chunk Knowledge:**
    - The government is attempting to exploit the ancient knowledge held by the [[Ho-Chunk]] people. They offer technological or financial incentives to extract information but face resistance from the community.
9. **Monitoring Time Anomalies:**
    - Project Caroline is keeping close tabs on the time anomalies in Watashuka, particularly around Caroline College. Their efforts to fix or control the time loop bring them into conflict with both the cults and the Amish.
10. **Colluding with Cults:**
- Certain elements within Project Caroline have begun secretly working with the cult of [[Yog-Sothoth]], believing that aligning with the cult could provide them the edge they need in understanding and controlling eldritch powers.

# Campaign Setting Secrets
# True Timeline of the Region - The Story Bible
## **Pre-1850s**
- **Ancient History**: The region that would become Watashuka is situated at the convergence of several ley lines, making it a place of supernatural significance. The Ho-Chunk people, who have inhabited the area for centuries, are aware of the ley lines’ power and use their knowledge to protect the land from dark forces. The ley lines are believed to be spiritual conduits, connecting this world to ancient, unknowable cosmic forces.
## **May 1856** – **Prairieville Academy** Founded by Occultists
- **Prairieville Academy** is established by a group of occultists led by **Walter Mann**, **Eleazar Root** and **John W. Sterling**. They recruited three locals, with a less than pristine past, to clear the lands of the local tribes and abduct the first 'students'. The academy’s true purpose is to gather young students, particularly Native American youths, to perform dark rituals on in order to summon what Mann described as the 'original god'. Unknown to him, the god he dreamt of is the eldritch god, [[Cthulhu]].
- The idea for the school came to Mann in a dream. Root and Sterling were his first, and most loyal, recruits.
- The Academy is built at a key ley line nexus, chosen specifically for its supernatural energy.
- Their rituals target young Native American students, attempting to use their connection to the land and its power to fuel a major summoning.
- Unknown to each other, each founder is being influenced by a different eldritch entity but they think they are on the path to summoning the same "original god." They don’t realize they are being manipulated by [[Nyarlathotep]].
- Founding Members
		- Walter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy
		- Eleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated
		- John W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated 
		- Elias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen
		- Jonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian
		- Sarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist
## **August 1860** – Destruction of **Prairieville Academy** (Ritual Interrupted)
- The **Ho-Chunk** people, aware of the academy’s dark purpose, attack to stop a major ritual. This ritual involved the transformation of several Ho-Chunk youths for a summoning of the 'original god'.
- The Ho-Chunk succeed in halting the ritual and destroyed the academy in the process. Many die, including Mann and most of the original cult members. However, both **Eleazar Root** and **John W. Sterling** survive.
- The destruction of the Academy opens the way for the arrival of the [[Amish]], who recognize the ley lines and the region's supernatural danger. They quietly establish themselves to act as protectors of the land.
## **September 1862** – **Prairieville School** opened
- Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling, the surviving occultists, believe that the failed ritual must have been due to sabotage due to a deviation from the 'true path'. 
	- Root, following [[Shub-Niggurath]] forms [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]. This cult focuses on manipulating nature and fertility.
	- Sterling, following [[Yog-Sothoth]], forms [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]. This cult focuses on time manipulation and dimensional gates. 
- Both believe they are following the true way to summon the "original god" and view each other as being misled.
- The two cults have an uneasy relationship. Sometime waring against one another and sometimes cooperating; hoping to bring the other back to the 'true path'.
- Both cults compete to control key ley line nodes, conducting rituals at specific locations across the town, especially within Caroline College and its precursor institutions.
- Both cults reestablish themselves in secret under the guise of the rebuilt **Prairieville School**. They slowly gather power and influence over the next several decades, controlling different aspects of the school and infiltrating local society.
## January 1888 - **The Blizzard of 1888**
* The [[Blizzard of 1888]] sparked a turning point for the region. The failed ritual paved the way for a new faction, the [[Lutheran Church]] to enter the area.
## **April 1895 – Creation of **Caroline Religious Teaching College**
- The cults gain power through unsuspecting Lutheran immigrants, who push for the school’s expansion into **Caroline Religious Teaching College**. The immigrants believe they are establishing a religious institution, unaware that the cults are using their influence to mask their occult activities. Many devout Lutherans are tricked into taking part of the cults rituals. The Lutherans believe they have received divine messages from their God when in reality it is cult magic and deception. 
- The town is renamed **Watashuka**, a mistranslation of the Ho-Chunk word **Waceǧi**, meaning "dangerous," reflecting the native people's warning about the area.
## **1930s-1940s** – Cult Influence Spreads and **Project Caroline** Begins
- As WWII approaches, the cults’ activities intensify. The **U.S. government**, becoming aware of strange phenomena tied to the college and town, starts a secret research initiative called Project Caroline.
	- Publicly, this was known as [[Watashuka Initiative|the Watashuka Initiative]]
- Project Caroline is aimed at studying the supernatural phenomena in the region, initially under the guise of wartime research. However, its true focus is on harnessing eldritch power for potential military or espionage purposes.
- The Ostensibly wartime research, its true focus is on studying and controlling the supernatural power of the ley lines for military purposes and later towards winning the space race.
    - **Cult Manipulation**: During this time, the cults increase their influence over the college, using the chaos of the war to mask their own experiments and rituals. The Lutherans are nearly compromised by cult members who infiltrate their ranks, but the end of the war and the expansion of Project Caroline provide a temporary reprieve.
    - **Ritual Failure**: Another major cult ritual fails during this period, [[The Baptism of '39]], leading to another name change for the college. The post-war push for scientific expansion transforms the college into a modern liberal arts institution, **Caroline College**, though the cults remain entrenched. Its failure is what led to the government's involvement in the region.
## **1969 – Project Caroline "Ends," but Cults Step Up Activity**
- **Event**: Under the Nixon administration, Project Caroline is publicly terminated due to concerns over government overreach and having 'won' the space race. However, it is implied that Nixon himself was influenced by the cult of [[Yog-Sothoth]], seeking to end the government's interference and allow the cults to continue their work without oversight.
    - **Cults Take Advantage**: During this period, the cults believe they are finally free from government interference and ramp up their activities. 
    - **Secret Continuation**: After Nixon's removal from office, elements within the government begin quietly restarting Project Caroline, aiming to regain control of the supernatural forces around Watashuka without public scrutiny.
## **1970's - Secret Investigations
- **Secret Continuation**: After Nixon's removal from office, elements within the government begin quietly restarting Project Caroline, aiming to regain control of the supernatural forces around Watashuka without public scrutiny.
- 1975: OTA begins investigation into the records around Caroline College.
- 1976: Special Agent Dayton Hopper goes missing during a cattle mutilation investigation.
- 1978: In December, Special Agent Dayton 'appears' at the bottom of Lake Mann. He is rescued by campus security. For him only a night had passed since his disappearance. He is mutated into a 'part man, part tree' creature. His report was incomplete due to his death as a result of the mutation. It highlighted some cult plans around campus.
- 1979: New funding allocated to Project Caroline
## 1980's - Project Caroline Rebooted
- 1980: Project Caroline, in secret, is restarted under OTA direction this time.
	- With renewed Cold War funding, Project Caroline returns, this time with a stronger focus on using the ley lines to manipulate time and space for military advantage. However, this leads to increasingly dangerous interactions with the cults, who now see the government as a direct competitor for supernatural power.
- 1981: [[Amy Mann]] is recruited to the project out of graduate school. She is a genius was on path to finish her first pH.d at 21. Her field of study is the physics of time. Government influence shaved a year off of her program.
- **1981:**
    - Spring: Shub-Niggurath cult begins experimenting on pregnant women at the teaching hospital.
    - Fall: Dave starts broadcasting "Metal At Midnight" on a pirate radio station.
- **1982:**
    - Spring: Yog-Sothoth cult gains influence within Caroline College, increasing tensions with the Shub-Niggurath cult.
    - Fall: Campus radio broadcasts of "Metal At Midnight" become more frequent but chaotic.
- **1982:** Dr. Amy Mann relocates to Caroline college.
	- Dr. Amy Mann, a brilliant physicist recruited by the OTA, arrives at Caroline College to conduct experiments related to time manipulation. Unbeknownst to her, her work interacts with the ley lines and an ongoing [[Yog-Sothoth]] ritual, resulting in the creation of a **time loop** from 1983 to 1987.
- **1983**: OTA agents, including Dr. Mann hatch a plan to pose as students to gain access to sites of special interest without cult knowledge.
- **1983:** August 22<sup>nd</sup>, Fall semester begins at Caroline College
- **1983**: August 29<sup>nd</sup>, Dr. Amy Mann goes missing (presumed murdered) after witnessing a ritual by [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]. Local start a manhunt for the student 'Amy Mann'. In reality, Dr. Mann is pulled into an accidental time loop created by unforeseen interactions with the ritual that night and an experiment she was running in 1987.
	- **Time Loop Details**: The loop resets every few years, trapping the region in a repeating cycle. The highest-ranking cultists, aware of the loop, use it to continually attempt their summoning rituals, refining their efforts with each iteration. However, they cannot fully break free from the loop without completing their final ritual.
	- Ho-Chunk Involvement: [[Ho-Chunk]] leaders can sense the loop and attempt to pass information from one loop to the next via dream visions, information left at ley lines and group memories.
	- **Amy Mann’s Role**: Amy becomes the anchor for the time loop, disappearing at the start of each cycle after witnessing a cult ritual. If she can be saved or prevented from initiating the loop, the cycle can be broken, though this would only give the players a limited window to prevent the ultimate summoning of the "original god."
## **1983-1987** – Life in the loop
- **Project Caroline** continues secretly, with government agents posing as students, faculty, and local authorities. The cults remain entrenched within the college and the town, manipulating events to serve their eldritch masters.
- The population of Watashuka continues to experience strange occurrences: hauntings, disappearances, and unexplained phenomena. The time loop ensures that no permanent damage is done, as everything resets after a few years, but the players may be able to break the cycle and uncover the true nature of the town’s cursed existence.
- Each iteration of the loop sees a 'shuffling' of locations, events and some individuals. Key locations, events and individuals remain constant, if slightly changed.
	- Each loop ALWAYS starts with the disappearance of Amy Mann.
## **1987 – The Cults’ Ultimate Goal**
- **Event**: Both cults believe that 1987, specifically **February 23**, is the key date for completing their rituals. The alignment has not been this strong since August of 1860 (when the original school was destroyed). An alignment with the Large Magellanic Cloud provides the perfect opportunity for summoning their "original god," though they do not realize this will summon **Cthulhu**, leading to their own destruction.
    - **Endgame**: If the players fail to prevent the ritual, the time loop will break, and the full force of Cthulhu will be unleashed on the world. The cults, unaware of the true nature of their "god," will be the first to be annihilated, followed by the town and eventually, the planet.
    - **This has happened before**: In an attempt to save humanity, Dr. Mann initiated the original time loop.

# **The Watashuka Initiative**
---
**Report Summary:**
**Project Title:** Watashuka Initiative, colloquially 'Project Caroline'
**Duration:** 1940 - 21 December 1969  
**Location:** Watashuka, Midwest U.S.  
**Primary Focus:** Scientific Research into Agricultural Development and Food Preservation
---
**Background and Purpose:**  
The **Watashuka Initiative** was established in the early 1940s under the auspices of the U.S. government's Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), as part of a broader effort to investigate and develop underutilized rural regions in America. Officially framed as an agricultural research and development project, the Watashuka Initiative focused on improving farming techniques, soil fertility, and maximizing land usage in the fertile Midwest. The program, initially spurred by the needs of wartime agricultural production during World War II, aimed to harness new technologies and scientific advancements to benefit local farming communities, particularly around the **Caroline Religious Teaching College**. The teaching college always had a strong agricultural program so it made a logic choice. Under government directive, the school was renamed to **[[Caroline College]]**.
Beyond agricultural research, the project also explored regional geological and meteorological phenomena, seeking to understand the unusual weather patterns and natural occurrences reported in the area. The combination of scientific curiosity, wartime necessity, and regional investment helped the Initiative gain a reputation as a forward-looking, government-backed research project.
**Major Accomplishments:**
- **Agricultural Development:** The Watashuka Initiative was responsible for significant advancements in agricultural practices in the region. It introduced new crop rotation systems, irrigation methods, and fertilizer technologies that helped increase yields for local farmers. These developments were quickly adopted by the broader Midwest agricultural community.
- **Community Engagement:** The Initiative fostered strong ties between the government and the local population. In addition to improving agricultural output, it funded the construction of local infrastructure, including roads, irrigation systems, and educational facilities associated with **Caroline College**.
- **Scientific Research:** While primarily focused on agriculture, the Watashuka Initiative also conducted research into unusual environmental phenomena reported in the area. These studies were part of an effort to explain the strange occurrences observed by local residents, though no official explanations were ever publicly released.
- **Food Preservation**: In support of the space race, the program began to research new methods of food preservation for long term space travel.
**Closure of the Watashuka Initiative:**  
In 1969, amid growing public scrutiny, and concerns over government overreach, the **Watashuka Initiative** was officially terminated under the directive of **President Richard Nixon**. The decision came as part of a broader effort to scale back federal programs and reduce government intervention in local affairs. Publicly, the closure was framed as a result of the project’s success in modernizing the region’s agriculture and a shift in national priorities following the end of the space race.
However, rumors circulated that the real reason for the closure involved internal government reports indicating the program had strayed from its original purpose. Allegedly, some researchers had begun investigating anomalous phenomena in the Watashuka area, raising concerns about the safety and ethics of continuing such research. Despite these rumors, the official explanation remained that the Initiative had completed its goals and was no longer necessary.
**Legacy:**  
Though officially ended, the legacy of the Watashuka Initiative can still be seen today in the local infrastructure and agricultural techniques implemented during the program. Watashuka remains a hub of rural farming activity, with many of the advancements introduced by the Initiative continuing to benefit the local economy. Additionally, the Initiative's closure led to a lingering sense of mystery in the region, with residents occasionally referencing the program in relation to the strange and unexplained events that continue to occur. To this day, some locals speculate that the government’s decision to close the project may have been influenced by more than just agricultural successes, though no official records support these claims.
---
**Final Status:** Terminated (1969) under presidential directive. All research and operational activities officially ceased.

Secrets of [[Blizzard of 1888]]
- In **January of 1888**, [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] attempted a grand ritual aimed at corrupting the region's ley lines, intending to use the supernatural power of the land to summon the "original god." This ritual involved a sacrifice that would unleash a torrent of dark energy, warping nature itself to feed [[Shub-Niggurath]]. The ritual’s climax was meant to bring a period of supernatural fertility to the region, but instead, it triggered a catastrophic and unnatural event—the infamous [[Blizzard of 1888]].
- The blizzard was no ordinary snowstorm. It swept across the region, dropping temperatures at an unprecedented rate and covering the land in feet of snow within hours. Animals froze in place, and entire homesteads were buried beneath the onslaught. The sky itself seemed to warp, as if torn between dimensions, with flashes of unnatural lightning illuminating the storm. It became clear that the storm was not a mere force of nature, but a manifestation of the ley lines reacting violently to the unfinished ritual.
* **The [[Amish-Keeper]] and [[Ho-Chunk]] Intervention**:  
	* Both the **Amish** and the **Ho-Chunk** communities, with their deep understanding of the ley lines and supernatural forces, quickly realized that the blizzard was the result of the botched ritual. Though hesitant to cooperate due to cultural and religious differences, they understood that the survival of the land—and possibly the world—depended on stopping the storm.
	* **The Ho-Chunk**: Led by spiritual elders, the Ho-Chunk used their ancient rituals to calm the ley lines. They identified sacred locations near the ritual site and channeled the land’s energy to create barriers that would prevent the cult's power from further spreading. Ho-Chunk warriors, braving the supernatural storm, ventured close to the cult’s gathering, disrupting their ritual by destroying key artifacts and symbols that were amplifying the storm's intensity.
	* **The Amish**: The Amish, guided by their secret knowledge passed down through generations, performed a series of protective rituals centered on grounding the ley lines. Using ancient symbols and herbal remedies, they worked to absorb and nullify the dark energies being unleashed. Their actions were crucial in preventing the corruption from spreading to the surrounding farmland. A select group of Amish elders ventured to the heart of the storm, using their knowledge of herbal magic to counteract the ritual’s effects on nature, effectively calming the storm’s destructive force.
	* Together, the Amish and Ho-Chunk managed to weaken the blizzard and break the ley line's connection to the cult’s ritual site. By dawn, the worst of the storm had passed, though it left the region covered in snow and ice, with many homes and farms destroyed.
* **Aftermath for the Cult**:  
	* The **Church of the Delayed Blossom** suffered a major defeat. Several high-ranking members were killed in the blizzard, unable to control the forces they had unleashed. The remaining cultists were forced to flee, retreating deeper underground to rebuild their strength. Their failure weakened their influence over the land, leaving them fractured and desperate. Some members blamed the botched ritual on interference from [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]], further deepening the divide between the two groups.
	* This monumental failure of the ritual, combined with the blizzard’s devastating effects, attracted the attention of the local Lutheran population. Seeing the region as in need of moral and spiritual guidance, Lutheran leaders moved to establish themselves in the area. By **1890**, the region had been renamed **[[Watashuka]]**, and the **Caroline Religious Teaching College** was founded. The Lutherans, unaware of the deeper supernatural forces at play, believed their arrival signaled divine intervention, unaware that the true cause of the storm had been an eldritch power narrowly averted by the joint efforts of the Amish and Ho-Chunk.
* **Legacy of the Blizzard**:  
	* Locals still speak of the Blizzard of 1888 with reverence and fear. Though few know the truth, whispers of unnatural forces tied to the storm persist, passed down through generations. The event marked a turning point in the town’s hidden history, with the cults driven deeper underground, the Lutherans unknowingly filling the power vacuum, and the Amish and Ho-Chunk remaining ever-vigilant to prevent such a catastrophe from repeating.

# Blizzard of 1888
The **Blizzard of 1888** is remembered as one of the most devastating natural disasters in [[Watashuka|Watashuka's]] history. In **January 1888**, a sudden and violent snowstorm swept across the region, burying homes, freezing livestock, and leaving the town struggling for survival. The storm was so intense that temperatures dropped to dangerous levels within hours, and snowdrifts reached several feet, isolating entire communities. The storm lasted for days, leaving a landscape of snow and ice that destroyed much of the area’s infrastructure.
**Impact on the Town**: Entire families were trapped in their homes, and the storm claimed the lives of many who couldn’t escape its reach. Farmers lost livestock, crops were ruined, and the town’s growing population faced severe food shortages in the weeks that followed. For many, the blizzard was seen as a sign of the region’s unforgiving nature, with settlers wondering whether the land could truly be tamed.
**Relief Efforts and the [[Great Influx]]**: The disaster triggered a humanitarian response from [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] settlers, particularly from German immigrant communities who traveled to the region to provide aid. These settlers brought food, supplies, and the knowledge needed to survive such harsh conditions. Known as the **Great Influx**, this movement of Lutheran immigrants not only helped the region recover but also led many to stay and settle in Watashuka, laying the foundation for the town’s strong Lutheran presence.
By **1890**, many of these settlers had established churches and schools, and their contributions helped Watashuka rebuild after the storm. The **[[Caroline College|Caroline Religious Teaching College]]** was founded as a direct result of their efforts to educate future generations and provide spiritual guidance to the region. This period marked the beginning of a new era for the town, with the Lutheran Church playing a key role in shaping its cultural and religious identity.
**Legacy**: The Blizzard of 1888 is still spoken of with awe and respect by the people of Watashuka. It is remembered as a turning point in the town’s history, not only for the lives lost but for the resilience and community spirit it inspired. The storm solidified the town’s Lutheran roots and marked the arrival of a new chapter in its development, as settlers turned tragedy into opportunity. The blizzard is commemorated in local history as a testament to the strength and faith of those who survived.

**January 12, 1897**  
_Watashuka, Wisconsin, United States_
**Dear Brother Heinrich,**
I trust this letter finds you in good health, and I pray the Lord’s blessings continue to rest upon your ministry in Germany. It has been nearly nine years since I arrived in this distant land, and I feel it is finally time to recount for you the story of our **Great Influx** into what we now call [[Watashuka]] - a story of both hardship and divine providence.
As you may recall, in January of **1888**, a [[Blizzard of 1888|terrible blizzard]] struck this region. The storm was like none we had ever seen, a merciless torrent of snow and ice that swallowed entire homes and froze men, women, and livestock in their place. It was a catastrophe that left the land paralyzed, and many of the early settlers here wondered if God had forsaken this place.
But it was in the midst of this devastation that the Lord called us, His faithful servants, to action. Word of the suffering reached our Lutheran congregations scattered across neighboring states, and we knew we could not stand idle. The people of Watashuka were in dire need—not only of food and shelter but of hope. I, along with many other brothers and sisters in the faith, packed our wagons with what provisions we could muster and set out for this desolate land.
What we found upon our arrival was a sight of utter ruin. Fields that had once been fertile lay buried under the snow, and the faces of those we came to help were gaunt with despair. Yet, through their trials, we saw a flicker of light—the potential for a new community to rise from these ashes. With the Lord’s guidance, we brought what aid we could, but more importantly, we brought with us the message of His love and salvation.
By the grace of God, many of us chose to stay. What began as a mission of relief soon turned into something far greater—a new beginning. We built churches, schools, and homes, binding ourselves to this land and to one another. In the years since, we have seen Watashuka grow. The **Caroline Religious Teaching College** was established just two years ago in **1895**, and it has already become a beacon of learning and faith for the region. Here, young men and women are being trained not only in the ways of the world but in the Word of God, ensuring that this land will continue to be a place of faith and righteousness.
The trials we faced during that dreadful winter were not in vain. We now see that the Lord used the blizzard not as a punishment but as a test, a crucible through which this community could be forged. Those of us who arrived in the wake of the storm have come to be known as the **Great Influx**, and though we did not seek such recognition, it is clear that God had a plan for us. We were His hands and feet in a time of great need, and now we are the foundation of a growing and devout Lutheran community. This morning alone we have lain the cornerstone for our new church. 
I write all this to you, dear Heinrich, not to boast of our works but to testify to the Lord’s faithfulness. He has turned a great disaster into an opportunity for His glory to shine, and it is with a grateful heart that I share this story with you.
May God continue to bless you in your ministry, as He has so richly blessed us here in Watashuka. I look forward to hearing news of your work in Germany, and I pray that one day you might visit this place to see with your own eyes what the Lord has accomplished through us.
In His Service,  
_Pastor Wilhelm Kraus_

# The Baptism of '39
(_The Event that Triggered Government Involvement and the Founding of Project Caroline_)
## **Event Description**:  
The supernatural disaster that locals now call **The Baptism of '39** was the result of a failed time-manipulation ritual by [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]. What began as a sinister attempt to manipulate the ley lines and access alternate timelines spiraled out of control when misled members of the **Lutheran Church**, believing they were conducting a mass baptism, became unwitting participants in the ritual.
## **The Cover Story**:  
According to the official—and widely believed—version of events, the **Lutheran pastor**, **Reverend Frederick "Fred" Olsen**, led a congregation down to **Lake Mary** for a large-scale baptism ceremony on **October 13, 1939**. The pastor, a well-respected man in his 50s with a warm and charismatic presence, had recently gathered a group of new converts who were eager to be baptized together. The ceremony took place at dusk, with over a dozen parishioners, young and old, standing along the shore of the lake, singing hymns and preparing to enter the water.
As they began the ritual, something went terribly wrong. Inexplicable phenomena occurred—strange lights flickered above the water, and a sudden, bone-chilling fog rolled in from nowhere. The water in the lake rose, unnaturally high, forming bizarre swirling patterns. Congregants were pulled into the water by unseen forces, while others stood frozen in place, unable to move or speak. The skies above seemed to shimmer, and witnesses described seeing distorted reflections in the lake—visions of past and future events, alternate versions of themselves, and eerie figures that never existed.
The church members were trapped in what seemed like a **time anomaly**, as the rising waters of Lake Mary acted as a temporal gateway. Some were thrown forward in time, while others vanished entirely. A few survivors were found later, dazed and confused, with no memory of the event beyond stepping into the water. Local authorities chalked it up to a freak accident, but those closest to the church whispered about **demonic interference**.
## **The True Cause**:  
Unbeknownst to **Reverend Olsen** or his congregation, the baptism was actually the culmination of a ritual being conducted by [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]. Cultists embedded within the congregation had altered the baptism’s timing and location to coincide with an arcane ritual designed to manipulate time. Their goal was to create a rift in time using the ley lines converging at **Lake Mary**, allowing them to gain knowledge from alternate dimensions and use that power to summon the "original god."
However, the interference of the Lutheran congregation—believing they were engaged in a holy ritual—disrupted the cult’s carefully laid plans. The energy they had hoped to harness from the ley lines surged out of control, and instead of manipulating time in a controlled way, they unleashed an unstable rift. The rising waters of Lake Mary became a temporal whirlpool, pulling people into alternate timelines and distorting reality.
## **Aftermath**:
- **For the Cults**:  
	- [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]] suffered a major setback. The ritual had backfired spectacularly, resulting in the deaths or disappearances of several high-ranking cult members who were caught in the time anomaly. Some cultists were flung into the future or past, while others were twisted into bizarre, unrecognizable forms by their exposure to alternate dimensions. The Brotherhood’s leadership was left fractured, and they were forced to retreat deeper into secrecy to rebuild their power and recover from the failed ritual.
	- [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. [[Shub-Niggurath]], often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence. See below    
- **For the Lutheran Church**:  
    Reverend Fred Olsen was devastated by the event. He had no knowledge of the cult’s involvement, and in his eyes, the tragedy was a catastrophic accident—a test of faith. Reverend Olsen became more reclusive in the years following the event, haunted by the loss of his parishioners. The survivors, confused and traumatized, were never the same, and many left the church. The Baptism of '39 remains a stain on the church’s history, and the Lutheran congregation worked hard to distance themselves from the event, reinforcing the cover story that it had been a freak natural disaster.   
- **For the Town**:  
    Most locals accepted the church’s explanation of the event. While rumors of supernatural occurrences circulated, particularly among older residents, the official story held. The **Baptism of '39** became a cautionary tale about the dangers of Lake Mary, with many avoiding the lake after dark for fear of "bad luck" or worse. The lake developed a reputation for being haunted, and strange phenomena continued to be reported in the years following the event—echoes of voices from the past, distorted reflections in the water, and the occasional unexplained disappearance.   
## **Government Involvement and the Birth of Project Caroline**:  
While the locals might have accepted the cover story, the government took notice of the strange anomalies surrounding the Baptism of '39. Reports of missing persons, time distortions, and bizarre weather patterns at Lake Mary reached the desk of **Agent Howard Fitzsimmons**, a sharp and inquisitive investigator with the **Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)**—a government agency tasked with exploring unusual phenomena, especially during the early years of WWII.
Fitzsimmons, in his early 40s and known for his no-nonsense approach, was sent to investigate. He quickly determined that something far more unusual than a baptism had taken place. Interviews with survivors and local authorities, as well as his own experience with classified government experiments, led Fitzsimmons to conclude that the ley lines around Lake Mary had been disturbed by some kind of occult activity. He suspected that the event was tied to **time manipulation**, though he lacked concrete evidence.
Fitzsimmons’ report to the OSRD recommended further investigation into the supernatural properties of the Watashuka region. His superiors, impressed by his findings and the potential implications for time manipulation in wartime technology, authorized the creation of [[Project Caroline]] in 1940. Fitzsimmons was appointed as the project’s first director, tasked with uncovering the secrets of the ley lines and understanding how the energies around Watashuka could be harnessed.
## **Legacy of the Baptism of '39**:  
The Baptism of '39 became the founding event for **Project Caroline**, the top-secret government initiative that would study the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka for decades to come. Fitzsimmons’ work laid the foundation for the project’s ongoing investigation into time anomalies, ley lines, and the influence of the cults operating in the shadows of the town.
Though Reverend Olsen and the Lutheran Church continued to distance themselves from the tragedy, the event marked the beginning of a new chapter in Watashuka’s secret history—one where government agents, cults, and local residents became unwitting players in a much larger cosmic game.
## The Wet Spot: The Aftermath of a Failed Ritual
(A Cult Capitalizing on Rival Failure and Hidden Desires)
The Baptism of '39 of 1939 not only left deep scars on Watashuka's lakes and time itself but also created lingering, unseen consequences in the land and people near Lake Mary. While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled suffered a tremendous setback from their failed time manipulation ritual, their rivals— [[Church of the Delayed Blossom]] —saw an opportunity.
The botched ritual had temporarily destabilized the ley lines near Lake Mary, leaving the area around it highly susceptible to supernatural corruption and manipulation. The Delayed Blossom cult saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. [[Shub-Niggurath]], often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence.
### The Founding of The Wet Spot:
In the early 1940s, shortly after the Baptism of '39, a quiet shift occurred in the area just beyond the town limits, near Lake Mary. What had once been a respectable lakeside resort fell into disrepair, as locals avoided the area due to the unnatural feelings of discomfort and fear. Without fully understanding why, residents felt uneasy near the water, especially at night. Many reported strange dreams or sudden impulses they couldn’t explain.
Sensing the opportunity, members of the Church of the Delayed Blossom began subtly influencing the land and those who still ventured near Lake Mary. Over time, their efforts coalesced into something more overt. In 1952, under the guidance of "Big" Tony D’Amato, an outsider with connections to the town’s seedier elements, The Wet Spot was established. Officially an adult establishment, The Wet Spot catered to the baser instincts of the town's population—sex, indulgence, and secrecy. Unofficially, it became a node of power for the Delayed Blossom, feeding off the suppressed desires of its patrons and slowly corrupting the land further.
### The Church of the Delayed Blossom’s Influence:
The Church of the Delayed Blossom thrives on exploiting the primal, chaotic aspects of humanity, particularly sexuality, fertility, and uncontrolled growth. The establishment of The Wet Spot near Lake Mary, on land already tainted by the failed ritual, allowed the cult to further anchor their influence in Watashuka.
- Sexuality as a Tool: For the Delayed Blossom cult, sexuality is not just a human urge—it is a form of power. By opening an establishment like The Wet Spot, the cult taps into the suppressed desires of the town, using the indulgence of lust and vice as a way to fuel their rituals. The sexual energy released at the club serves as a type of fertility magic, subtly warping the land and spreading Shub-Niggurath’s influence through the area.
- Twisting the Failure: While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in their time manipulation, the Delayed Blossom found a way to benefit from the weakened ley lines. The ritual’s disruption left Lake Mary’s surroundings spiritually vulnerable, making it easier for the Delayed Blossom to exert their influence over the region and its residents. The Wet Spot, positioned in an area avoided by most locals, became a hidden focal point for the cult’s activities.
### The Wet Spot’s Reputation:
To this day, The Wet Spot maintains its outward appearance as a sleazy but profitable adult establishment, frequented by college students and visitors passing through. While most of the town avoids the place, chalking it up to personal morals or discomfort, many don’t realize that the real reason they stay away stems from the lingering supernatural energy left over from the 1939 event.
- Strange Atmosphere: Those who do visit often report a strange atmosphere in the club. The air feels thick, like it’s charged with something unexplainable. Time seems to slow, and people lose track of the hours they spend inside. There are rumors that some patrons have gone missing, never seen again after a night out at the club, though this is written off as typical seedy rumors.
- Unnatural Growth: Unbeknownst to most, The Wet Spot serves as a breeding ground for darker, more unnatural forces. The cult uses the energy of indulgence and sexual desire to foster their connection to Shub-Niggurath. Some areas near the club are marked by strange growths—twisted plants, unusual fertility in the soil, and occasional sightings of hybrid creatures, believed to be the results of dark rituals.
- Dormant Power: The Delayed Blossom cult maintains a low profile, using The Wet Spot as a cover for their true activities. While not every patron is affected by the cult’s influence, those who frequent the establishment regularly often find themselves plagued by strange dreams and desires. Some even become unwitting pawns in the cult’s ongoing efforts to manipulate and corrupt the town’s ley lines.
### Legacy of the Baptism of '39:
The Baptism of '39’s aftermath left scars not only on the landscape but on the people as well. The Wet Spot, though seemingly just an adult entertainment venue, is a lingering reminder of how the disrupted ritual in 1939 forever altered the spiritual fabric of Watashuka. Where the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in controlling time, the Church of the Delayed Blossom succeeded in harnessing the primal urges of humanity to further their influence in the town.
## **Key Figures**:
- **Reverend Frederick "Fred" Olsen**: Lutheran pastor who led the ill-fated baptism ceremony. A warm, charismatic man in his 50s, he was devastated by the events of 1939 and spent the rest of his life in quiet, guilt-ridden reflection.
- **Agent Howard Fitzsimmons**: Government investigator with the OSRD who was assigned to the case. His investigation into the Baptism of '39 led to the creation of **Project Caroline**, and he became its first director. Fitzsimmons was known for his sharp mind, skepticism, and unrelenting drive to uncover the truth.
- **"Big" Tony D’Amato**: Transplant from Indiana who established the Wet Spot under cult suggestion. Tony is not a cultist and tries to distance himself from their activities but at the end of the day, he is a businessman.

# **Tragedy at Lake Mary: Baptism Ceremony Ends in Disaster**
_October 14, 1939_  
By **[[Margaret Wilkins]]**, _The Prairie Press_
A serene autumn evening on the shores of **Lake Mary** turned tragic yesterday as a mass baptism led by **Reverend Frederick Olsen** ended in disaster. What should have been a joyous occasion for the Lutheran Church has left the Watashuka community reeling, with several parishioners still unaccounted for.
The ceremony, intended to baptize new members of the church, began around dusk. Reverend Olsen, a man beloved by many in the congregation, led a group of thirteen down to the water’s edge, accompanied by the hymns and prayers of fellow churchgoers. The atmosphere was one of peace and spiritual renewal.
That peace was shattered when a thick fog rolled in from the lake, obscuring the shore. Witnesses reported strange lights hovering above the water and a sudden, unnerving stillness. What had been a calm and sacred moment swiftly turned to chaos.
“Something wasn’t right,” said **Helen Thomas**, one of the witnesses standing on the shore. “The fog wasn’t natural. It felt... alive. And those lights, they weren’t lanterns or reflections. It was like they were floating just above the lake, and the air felt wrong.”
Several of the parishioners, including Reverend Olsen, had entered the lake when the waters began to swell unnaturally, rising higher than anyone had seen before. According to witnesses, the water seemed to pull at those in the lake, dragging them in despite their efforts to return to shore.
“I heard them calling out for help, but we couldn’t reach them,” said **Peter McKenzie**, another witness. “It was like the water was alive, pulling them in.”
As the fog thickened, those still on the shore were frozen in place, unable to move or speak. Some reported seeing strange shapes in the mist, distorted reflections that did not match the figures standing at the lake.
“I saw myself,” said **Judith Harper**, one of the survivors, trembling. “But it wasn’t me. It was like a shadow of what I could have been—older, sadder. It didn’t make any sense.”
By the time the fog cleared, several of the participants had vanished into the lake, including longtime church member **Thomas Pierce** and new convert **Ellen Linton**. Reverend Olsen himself was pulled from the water by nearby parishioners, but several others were not so fortunate. Rescue efforts continued late into the night, but as of this morning, five parishioners remain missing.
The exact cause of the incident remains unclear. Sheriff **Albert Reynolds** described it as a “freak natural occurrence,” though he admitted that the suddenness and intensity of the fog were unusual for this time of year.
“It was a terrible accident,” said Reverend Olsen in a brief statement this morning. “We were there to celebrate God’s grace, and something went terribly wrong. I ask the community to join me in prayer for the missing and their families.”
The Lutheran Church is urging the public to avoid speculation, though whispers of supernatural interference have already begun to circulate. Some locals recall past stories of strange happenings at Lake Mary, though they have long been dismissed as folklore.
As the search for the missing continues, Watashuka is left grappling with the mystery of what truly happened at the lake. What was meant to be a peaceful baptism has turned into a chilling reminder that not all is as it seems beneath the surface of our town.

{Dave laughing maniacally}
Ohhhh yeah! It’s time to wake up, sleepyheads! I don't care if you've got your Old Spice or not. This is your friendly neighborhood madman, DAVE, comin’ at ya live with another installment. _Metal at Midnight_ is live and have I got somethin’ that’s gonna melt your mind faster than a Sabbath riff at double speed!
{Cue heavy metal track – “Specter at Dawn” by Nightstalker, featuring eerie riffs and relentless drumming.}
So, while all the fresh meat have been worrying about their exams, and dodging campus security, I’ve been out here diggin’ deep into the stuff THEY don’t want you to know. And tonight, we’re taking a little trip off the beaten path. We're heading up country away from our cozy little Watashuka... Let’s talk about somethin’ I call… the Black Lake Incident.
{Static and ominous feedback}
What? You've never heard of it? Yeah, figures. That's because GI Joe don't want you in the know. THEY made sure to bury this shit deeper than your last biology grade. Picture this: out in the middle of nowhere, deep in the northern woods—there’s a lake. Dave! We're in Wisconsin. We know lakes Dave! But you see, this ain't just any lake. It’s dark, man. Too dark. Black Lake. Real original name, right? I know. But this place? It ain’t like your summer camp getaways. No, this ain't no Crystal Lake. This is a place even Mr. Voorhees wouldn't book a cabin at.
{Distant, echoing whispers}
Back in ‘79, a whole group of people—locals, hikers, campers, hippies, - went missing there. Like, vanished off the face of the earth. And it wasn't just the people. Their cars, their tents, their gear, ALL of it just… gone. The lake? It swallowed them whole my little stoners. And allow me to shock and surprise absolutely no one - there’s no record of an official investigation. Oh sure, they’ll tell you it’s just another ‘urban legend,’ but when was the last time an urban legend came with classified government files?!
Now here’s where it gets really freaky. Word on the wire is that Project Blacklight, some super-secret government operation, was sent in to clean it all up. But they didn’t just show up with your run-of-the-mill troops. Oh no no my friends. They sent in special forces -paranormal specialists. Yeah, that’s right. The kind of guys that make the things that go bump in the night wet their sheets.
{Ominous drumming in the background}
Locals claim they saw military trucks rollin’ in, all blacked out. No lights, no sound. And get this—ever since that night, anyone who tries to camp near Black Lake ends up with the same nightmare. They wake up, choking, gasping for air, like something’s pulling them down. Drowning them. They say you can still hear the whispers if you listen close enough. 
But hey, I’m just your friendly neighborhood conspiracy nut, right?
And here’s where it gets even weirder. Rumor has it there’s some kind of ancient artifact buried deep beneath that water. Something older than grandfather time himself. Maybe the lake was always cursed, maybe it’s something the g-men did, maybe its this or maybe its that. I don't know man. But one thing I do know is that whatever they found there in ‘79, the government has been doing everything it can to cover it up. Reports buried, witnesses silenced, the whole shebang.
{Music fades in, "Buried Secrets" by Void Cross, fast and aggressive.}
So, if you’re thinking of takin’ a little weekend trip to Black Lake, let me just say... pack light, my tattooed freaks. Real light. And maybe bring some iron, ‘cause you never know what’s lurking beneath those waters.
{Sound of flipping through papers}
///But, hey, what do I know? I’m just a guy with a mic. Stay curious, stay skeptical, and remember… they’re always watching.
Alright, my metal militia, it’s time to sign off, but not before I drive one more nail of pure auditory rebellion into your skull. Keep your head on a swivel, ‘cause the truth is out there, man, and they don’t want you to find it. But I’ll be here, keepin’ it real for all you truth-seekers. Now go on, fight back, and crank this next one loud enough for them to hear all the way out at Black Lake!"_
{Outro song begins – “Whispers of the Dead” by Shrine of Dusk, slow and haunting.}
And remember, my metalheads… they’re out there, but so are we. Dave out!

# Metal At Midnight: Sister Sarah's Stinks
{WCTU is interrupted by static and electrical interference}
{ [[Dave]] laughing demonically}
Let there be METAL!
{Heavy metal song about expecting mothers who are happy to be part of a dark, strange, future}
Dave Is Back Babies. ‘Metal at Midnight’ is live and we’ve got all the music and news you need to survive this messed up little town. And speaking of news, we’ve got some real juicy nuggets for all you little pink faced freshmen joining our church of METAL for the first time. And believe me, its news that THEY do NOT want you to know.
We’re going live tonight because I know some of you little metal headed sideshow freaks have got class in that torture chamber known as Sister Sarah’s. And believe me, they are trying super hard to keep this quiet. So Dave’s going all School House Rock tonight. Knowledge is power! And power is what they don’t want you to have.
Yeah, that hospital’s all clean and bleachy fresh outside but in the back rooms … Oh brother, it’s Mike Myers meets that freaky little alien chest baby.
Us vets know it. We've heard the screams. We've seen shadows moving all weird. We've seen dumpsters getting collected late at night. Ain't no trashman working after midnight! Yeah, Sarah’s stinks alright so watch your back there.
Worst yet, THEY know it’s there! And Dave’s got the cancelled checks to prove it; right where you’d expect. In that nasty, creepy museum all the norms pass every day on their way to class. Prairie Hall is just a 24/7, 365, all you can eat charnel house with a receptionist. But they do keep records there….
Hell, someone call Mr. King; I've got a pitch for his next book!
{musical break}
They found me so it’s time to wrap.
But before I bounce remember…
{mimicking Churchill}
we’ll fight on the land,
we’ll fight in the fields and the streets,
we’ll fight in the hills,
we’ll never surrender
Someone call in the metal MILITIA!

# Metal At Midnight: Stratton Mill Fire
_WCTU signal cuts out with a burst of static and distant, distorted laughter._
Oh-ho-ho-ho, yeah! You know what time it is, you beautiful misfits! This is _Metal at Midnight_, and I’ve got some juice tonight that’s gonna twist your minds into knots. You think you know what’s goin’ on in this quiet little town? Hah! Buckle up, ‘cause tonight, we’re takin’ a ride down memory lane… but not the kind they print in those tourist brochures.
{Cue heavy metal track – “Buried Secrets” by Void Cross, fast and ominous with pounding drums.}
So, [[Watashuka]], our lovely little nowhere town—plenty of weird things have happened here, right? You’ve heard the whispers, the stories your parents won’t talk about. But there’s one incident that most of you’ve probably never even heard of, ‘cause it was scrubbed clean. Erased. Until now.
{Static crackles}
Ever heard of the Stratton Mill Fire? No? Yeah, they like it that way. It happened ten years ago, October 1973, and they’ve been keeping it under wraps ever since. That’s right, folks. Stratton Mill, one of the oldest buildings in town, went up in flames one chilly autumn night. But here’s the kicker… no one saw it burn. No one.
{Ominous guitar riff building in the background}
I know, I know, sounds like I’m making it up, right? A whole building burns down in the middle of town, and no one notices? But let me tell ya, there’s a reason for that. The fire wasn’t normal. It didn’t happen like you’re thinkin’. I dug deep, bro—old records, whispers from the few old-timers who still remember. And guess what? The fire was cold.
{Screeching feedback, then dead silence for a beat}
Yeah, you heard me. Cold fire. It burned, but the temperature dropped. People near the mill that night reported seeing blue flames and hearing this weird hum, like a vibration in the air. Some folks claim they saw shadowy figures walking into the fire like they were just taking a Sunday stroll. But here’s where it gets really freaky… there were no bodies. And when they found the building the next morning? Not even ash, man. Just… gone.
Now, here’s where it gets juicy. My sources tell me that the town’s finest, including our favorite boy in blue, [[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]], have been diggin’ into this for years. What they’re not tellin’ you is that there were three people missing that night—three workers who were never found. But the mill owners? They just quietly shut the whole thing down, and any record of it? Poof! Erased like it never happened.
Now, why would they go to all that trouble, huh? What’s so special about a little old mill burning down? Well, here’s a theory for you. The Stratton Mill wasn’t just a place for grinding grain. It was a meeting place for some real shady characters—people who dabbled in things they shouldn’t have. Rituals, man. Dark ones. And those ‘figures’ walking into the cold fire? They weren’t running from it. They were walking into it to disappear.
{Cue another heavy track – “The Haunter” by Death Mask, with eerie vocals and fast, thrashing guitars.}
Now, the official story, if you dig deep enough, says that there was a 'minor structural collapse' at the mill and that it was abandoned afterward. No big deal, right? But you won’t find any real records from the town on it. No fire report, no insurance claims, nothing. Why? Because they’re scared, bro. Scared of what really happened that night. And scared of what might still be hiding underneath those ruins.
{Sound of papers shuffling and Dave laughing under his breath}
Here’s a little nugget for you truth-seekers out there… I got wind that our good sergeant has been poking around the mill site again. It’s all locked up now, fences and all, but something—or someone—has been stirring things up over there. And it ain’t just rats in the walls, bro. So if you’re feeling brave, why not take a little midnight stroll to the Stratton Mill ruins and see for yourself?
{Sound of Dave tapping on the microphone}
Just don’t be surprised if you feel a chill in the air that’s got nothin’ to do with the weather. And hey, if you start hearin’ that hum? Run, dude. Run fast. ‘Cause whatever’s still hiding at the Stratton Mill… it’s cold, and it’s hungry.
{Music picks up – “Veil of Shadows” by Spectral Abyss, heavy and atmospheric, filled with dread.}
Alright, metal militia, time for me to disappear into the night before THEY try to shut me down again. Keep your ears to the ground, your minds sharp, and your amps cranked. And remember… truth is colder than fiction.
{Outro guitar fades out into static}
Till next time, freaks. Stay metal, stay alive.

# Metal At Midnight: The Repairman Returns
_WCTU is interrupted by static and electrical interference._  
{Dave laughing with a mix of sarcasm and intensity}  
"Ohhhh yeah! You thought you were safe tonight, huh? Well, think again, ‘cause it’s _Metal at Midnight_, and you’ve tuned in just in time for a real mind-bender! This time, we're diving deep into a story that’s been bouncing around Caroline College for years—long before any of you freshmen got here. And it just got a whole lot stranger.
But first, let’s talk about this new writer on the scene—he’s just a sophomore, but the stuff he’s coming up with, man? I’m telling ya, it’s like he’s tapped into something none of us are seeing. Let’s just call him _The Kid_ for now. You’ve never heard of him, but I guarantee you’re gonna hear a lot more about him real soon. He’s been adding his own twists to one of Caroline’s… longest-running stories."
{Cue heavy metal track: “Outsider” by Black Crucible, low and slow with ominous riffs.}  
"Now, this ain’t just your regular creative writing assignment, bro. Nah, it’s something much darker. You see, since ‘69, students have been passing down pieces of this story—building on it like a twisted game of telephone. No one’s ever heard the whole thing, and no one ever will ‘cause it changes every time someone adds a piece. But what’s freakin’ me out is _The Kid_… his latest entry? It’s like he knows more than he should.
Before I get into his part, you need to hear about where it all started. And wouldn’t you know it, it came from a former _WCTU_ host. A real talent. A native of Illinois, not Wisconsin, mind you. _Melissa Young_—yep, you might remember her. She vanished a little over a year ago, but before that? She was one of the best on the mic. But way before that, when she was a freshman, Melissa wrote this story about a TV repairman from her hometown. But it wasn’t just some ‘random inspiration,’ no sir. Word is, the story was based on something _real_—something that happened out in her neck of the woods."
{Sound of static crackling, then fading.}  
"So here’s how it went: This repairman, just your average Joe, used his job to rob people blind. Got caught, thrown in the slammer. End of story, right? Not exactly. _Melissa’s_ tale ended with him behind bars, but you could tell she was building to something bigger.
And then… last year. _The Kid_ wrote the next part, totally unaware of what Melissa had written. But get this—he picked up the story like he’d heard it before. Only… he hadn’t. His version? Well, it takes place years after the first part. The repairman’s out, but he’s not robbing houses anymore. No. Now he’s in the TVs, man! Not fixing them, not repairing them—he’s _inside them_. And whatever comes through that screen? It’s not cartoons, bro. It’s something twisted. Commercials that drive people mad. Shows that scare them to death. The repairman? He’s found a way to kill without even leaving the living room."
{Pause, eerie silence.}  
"Now, let me tell you, that _right there_ would be enough to keep me awake at night. But there’s more. _The Kid_, he’s been writing some other strange stuff, too. Stories about weird static showing up on people’s TV screens, and people claiming they saw someone moving behind the broadcast signal—someone who shouldn’t be there. And he’s written about that old, run-down place we all know as _The Hut_. Yeah, that’s right, the electronics shop over on Main. Apparently, some of those old TV sets? They ain’t exactly ‘gently used,’ if you catch my drift.
Buzz Horton—oh, he’s a character, man—he’s been selling more than a few of those old sets with some strange… side effects. Customers returning them, saying the TVs flicker when they’re off, or that they hear voices in the static. But hey, I’m just here to keep the airwaves creepy, right? What do I know? Just remember, there’s more to this than an old repairman and some busted electronics. Sometimes… things find a way to crawl through the static."
{Another crackle of static and feedback.}  
"But before I sign off for tonight, let me leave you with this little nugget of truth. You see, _Melissa_ was doing her thing on _Mystery Hour_ the night she disappeared. And guess what her last story was about? Yeah, you got it—the _repairman_. But it wasn’t just a story, no. She saw something that night. Right here, in the station. And her last words weren’t part of the script. She said, ‘He’s here… inside.’ Then, poof! Gone. No trace. So, you tell me, metal militia, was it all just a story, or was she trying to warn us about something coming through the airwaves?"
{Cue ominous metal track: “Into the Abyss” by Death’s Pulse, slow and heavy.}  
"So keep your eyes open, especially if you’re watching late-night TV. And maybe, just maybe, don’t leave that old set on when you’re not in the room. Because you never know who—or what—might be watching back. Dave out!"
_Broadcast cuts out with static, leaving the airwaves dead silent before regular programming resumes._

### **Lyrics**:
_(Verse 1)_  
Shadows flicker on the screen,  
Through static cracks, a ghost unseen,  
Whispers crawl across the light,  
Twisting truth into the night.
_(Chorus)_  
Into the abyss, we fall,  
No return, no voice to call.  
Eyes of fire, black as sin,  
Pull us deeper, pull us in.
_(Verse 2)_  
From the wires, the demon feeds,  
On your fears, on twisted needs.  
Lost within a broken line,  
Trapped between the space and time.
_(Chorus)_  
Into the abyss, we fall,  
No escape, no light at all.  
Eyes of terror, cold as death,  
Steal the air, steal your breath.
_(Bridge)_  
Sinking, sinking—can't break free,  
Bound by chains you cannot see.  
The signal fades, the pulse grows thin,  
The void awaits—it's pulling in.
_(Final Chorus)_  
Into the abyss, we descend,  
No beginning, and no end.  
Eyes of darkness, void of sound,  
Nowhere left, we’re lost and drowned.

**Description**:  
_“Into the Abyss”_ is a doom-laden track that blends slow, thunderous guitar riffs with eerie, distorted melodies. The vocals alternate between a guttural growl and haunting whispers, evoking an overwhelming sense of being trapped in an endless void. The song's lyrics speak of being pulled into a nightmare realm, where reality twists and there's no escape. The chorus is heavy and relentless, echoing the sense of falling deeper into something inescapable. Ideal for fans of dark, atmospheric metal.

# Adventure: Cold Flames at Stratton Mill
## **Setting**:
[[Watashuka]], Wisconsin, Early October 1983
## **Synopsis**:
The investigators are drawn into an investigation of the **Stratton Mill Fire**, a cold case from 1973 involving a mysterious blaze that left no trace of bodies or normal fire damage. As they dig deeper into the abandoned mill’s history, they discover that the fire was the result of a dark ritual performed by [[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]] . The ritual was meant to open a portal to another dimension, but something went wrong, leaving behind "cold fire" that still burns beneath the mill ruins, alongside spectral remnants of the failed ritual. The investigators must navigate the mill’s haunted grounds and uncover the truth before the Brotherhood attempts to complete what was left unfinished.
---
## **Keeper Information**:
The **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled** used the Stratton Mill as a site for their rituals, aiming to tear the veil between dimensions and bring forth eldritch knowledge and power. On the night of the fire, three cultists led a ritual to open the gate, but the energy they summoned spiraled out of control, consuming the mill in a fire that burned cold—something not of this world. The fire was not natural, and its source still lingers beneath the ruins, along with the restless spirits of the three cultists who perished. The Brotherhood has sent new members to try and finish what was started, using the "cold flame" as a gateway.
---
## **Adventure Hooks**:
- **A Cry for Help**:  
     [[Jan Ducochik|Sgt. Jan Ducochik]] has been investigating the fire in secret, and after uncovering a clue that points to a possible Brotherhood connection, he reaches out to the investigators for help. He’s too close to the case and fears that any more direct involvement will draw unwanted attention. The investigators must pick up where Ducochik left off.
- **Strange Activity at the Ruins**:  
    Locals report strange lights and eerie humming noises coming from the abandoned Stratton Mill. Some even claim to have seen shadowy figures moving around the site at night. The investigators are hired (by a town council member, a local journalist, or a business owner) to investigate whether trespassers or something more sinister is at play.
- **Unsettling Dreams**:  
    One or more of the investigators begin to have disturbing dreams of walking through blue flames, hearing whispers, and seeing shadowy figures beckoning them toward the ruins of the mill. The dreams are accompanied by a growing sense of dread that compels the investigators to visit the site.
---
## **Locations**:
- **Stratton Mill Ruins**:  
    The abandoned mill is a dilapidated structure, overgrown with weeds and vines, surrounded by a rusted chain-link fence. The area is eerily quiet, and the temperature around the ruins is unnaturally cold, even during the day. At night, strange blue flames can occasionally be seen flickering beneath the surface, and an otherworldly hum fills the air.
    - **Key Features**:
        - **The Mill Basement**: Beneath the ruins, the remnants of the ritual chamber still exist. Charred symbols line the floor, and the faint blue flames emanate from cracks in the foundation. The portal the cult attempted to open is unstable, leaking energy into the material world.
        - **The Cold Fire**: The "cold fire" is supernatural in origin and does not behave like a normal flame. It emits no heat and instead seems to drain warmth from the area. It can cause **Sanity Loss** for those who stare into it for too long.
        - **The Spectral Cultists**: The ghosts of the three cultists who perished in the failed ritual haunt the mill. They are trapped, reliving the moments before their deaths, unable to move on until the gate is either opened or closed forever.
- **[[Watashuka]] Town Records Office**:  
    Buried deep within the town’s old records are documents about the mill, including inspection reports, property deeds, and an old police report from the night of the fire. However, some of the documents are missing or have been tampered with, hinting at a cover-up.
    - **Key Clues**:
        - A copy of a report from a local police officer who responded to the fire. The report mentions seeing "strange figures" near the mill just before the fire, but the officer’s statement was dismissed as nonsense.
        - An old photo of the mill taken the day after the fire, showing the absence of ash or debris where the fire supposedly occurred.
- **The Brotherhood’s Safehouse**:  
    Unbeknownst to the investigators, the Brotherhood has a safehouse near the mill where they’ve been planning to finish the ritual. The building is an inconspicuous, run-down shack on the outskirts of town, but inside, the walls are covered in occult symbols and diagrams related to the portal. One of the Brotherhood members may be watching the investigators, keeping an eye on their progress.
---
## **Important NPCs**:
- **Sergeant Jan Ducochik**
    - **Role**: The investigator’s contact in town. Ducochik has been investigating the mill fire for years but has kept it quiet to avoid drawing attention. He has suspicions about the Brotherhood’s involvement but doesn’t have enough proof to act. He enlists the investigators’ help to uncover the truth and stop whatever is happening at the mill.
    - **Personality**: Serious, methodical, with a deep sense of duty to protect the town. While he doesn't fully believe in the supernatural, he’s seen enough strange things to know something is wrong.
- **The Spectral Cultists**
    - **Role**: Ghostly remnants of the Brotherhood members who died during the ritual. They are bound to the mill and attempt to lure the investigators into completing the ritual or destroying the gate for good.
    - **Appearance**: They appear as shadowy, indistinct figures, their faces contorted in terror, moving as if they’re still trying to complete the ritual. Their presence can cause **Sanity Loss**.
- **Brotherhood Operatives**
    - **Role**: The new members of the Brotherhood, sent to finish what was started. They are aware of the investigators’ interest in the mill and may try to stop them or manipulate them into completing the ritual on their behalf.
    - **Personality**: Cold, calculating, and ruthless. They are fanatically devoted to the Brotherhood’s goals, believing that opening the gate will bring them immense power.
---
## **Encounters**:
- **The Cold Fire**:  
    Investigators will have to deal with the cold fire that still burns beneath the mill. If they attempt to approach or interact with it, they will experience strange phenomena, such as the air around them freezing, voices whispering in their ears, and flashes of the night of the fire. The fire can only be extinguished by severing its connection to the portal, which will require an occult ritual of their own.
    - **Sanity Loss**: Looking directly into the cold fire for more than a few moments causes 1d4 **Sanity Loss**. Being touched by the fire causes 1d6 **Sanity Loss** and 1d4 physical damage, though the fire leaves no visible wounds.
- **Spectral Manifestations**:  
    The ghosts of the three cultists will attempt to manipulate the investigators into completing the ritual by guiding them deeper into the mill. The investigators may see the cultists’ final moments play out before them, or hear them chanting in the shadows. At times, the ghosts may turn hostile if they feel the investigators are trying to stop the ritual.
    - **Combat Option**: While the ghosts cannot be fought physically, they can be banished by breaking the ritual’s connection to the cold fire.
- **The Brotherhood’s Interference**:  
    Once the investigators are close to uncovering the truth, the new members of the Brotherhood will take action. They may attempt to sabotage the investigators' efforts, lure them into a trap, or even trick them into completing the ritual by pretending to be allies. If the investigators discover the Brotherhood’s safehouse, they can find critical clues about how to close the gate.
---
## **Climax**:
The final showdown takes place in the **Mill Basement**, where the cold fire burns the brightest, and the portal to another dimension flickers just out of view. The investigators must decide whether to close the portal once and for all, banishing the cold fire and the cultists’ spirits, or allow the Brotherhood to complete the ritual, risking the unleashing of eldritch horrors.
- **Closing the Portal**: The investigators will need to use **Occult Knowledge** and gather materials from the Brotherhood’s safehouse to sever the connection between the cold fire and the portal. This requires a successful **Occult** roll and possibly the destruction of the mill ruins to prevent the Brotherhood from ever attempting the ritual again.
- **Failing to Stop the Ritual**: If the Brotherhood succeeds in completing the ritual, the portal will open fully, allowing a powerful, otherworldly entity to cross into this dimension. The investigators will need to flee as the entity begins warping reality around them, or face it in a desperate struggle for survival.
---
## **Aftermath**:
- **Success**: If the investigators close the portal and extinguish the cold fire, the spirits of the cultists will be freed, and the mill will be at peace. Sergeant Ducochik will be grateful for their help, though the town may never know the full truth. However, the Brotherhood may still be watching, waiting for another opportunity.
- **Failure**: If the investigators fail to stop the ritual, the portal will remain open, and strange phenomena will begin to plague Watashuka. The Brotherhood will have gained power, and the town’s supernatural troubles will escalate.
---
## **Rewards**:
- **Sanity Gain**: Closing the portal and laying the cultists to rest grants 1d6 **Sanity**.
- **Experience**: Investigators will gain experience for uncovering the truth about the mill fire, outsmarting the Brotherhood, and banishing the cold fire.

# Adventure: Inside The Screen
**Setting**: [[Watashuka]], Fall 1983  
**Trigger Event**: During a late-night _Metal at Midnight_ show, hosted by the mysterious [[Dave]], the characters hear a cryptic reading of passages from a sophomore's story. The story is eerie, detailing a TV repairman who haunts his former customers by becoming part of their television broadcasts. [[[[Dave]] suggests the author, whom he refers to only as "The Kid," knows more than he’s letting on, hinting at a deeper truth behind the fictional tale.
---
### **The Hook**
The characters tune into _Metal at Midnight_, a popular local radio show known for its bizarre mix of metal music and dark, cryptic commentary. During the broadcast, Dave reads from an anonymous writer’s work, a sophomore at Caroline College. The chilling story about a TV repairman who infiltrates people’s screens resonates with the players. Dave finishes the segment with an ominous message:
_"The Kid, he's no ordinary writer, folks. He's seen things... things he can’t explain, things I’ve tried to ignore. Maybe some of you know him, but I’m not naming names. Just know that his stories, they come from somewhere real. And if you’re unlucky, maybe you’ll see for yourself."_
The players can’t shake the feeling that the story is connected to something happening in Watashuka.
See [[The Repairman Returns]]
---
### **Investigation Begins**
The players begin their investigation by following the clues from Dave’s broadcast. They can pursue the following leads:
1. **Dave’s Show**: If the players contact WCTU to ask about Dave, they’re stonewalled—no one at the station seems to know who Dave is. His show _Metal at Midnight_ is listed, but it’s treated as a joke among the station staff. However, they mention Melissa Young, a former host of _Mystery Hour_, who disappeared after reading a story that sounds eerily similar to Dave’s broadcast.
2. **Alan Sanders**: Through investigation, the players can connect "The Kid" to Alan Sanders, a shy and creative sophomore at Caroline College. When approached, Alan is evasive, claiming that his story was just a dream. However, he becomes visibly anxious when asked how he came up with the TV repairman character, deflecting further questions.
3. **The Hut (Electronics and Appliance Store)**: If the players dig into the theme of the TV repairman, they’ll discover that Watashuka’s local electronics store, _The Hut_, owned by Jerry “Buzz” Horton, has recently been selling strange, outdated television sets. These TVs have been returned by customers complaining of strange interference and distorted broadcasts. Buzz is a friendly but chaotic man who brushes off the complaints, calling them "technical glitches."
---
### **The Truth Behind the Story**
Alan Sanders has been unknowingly tapping into a dark, occult force linked to _The Hut_. Buzz Horton has been collecting old television sets from strange sources, many of which are imbued with a malevolent presence. One particular set was once owned by a former Caroline College student from the late 1960s, and it was used in a ritual by a local cult seeking to manipulate broadcasts. The ritual failed, but it left the TV cursed—able to channel eldritch energies and connect to the _Outer God Nyarlathotep_ through broadcast signals.
Alan’s story wasn’t just a creative work—it was a reflection of the entity lurking inside these old TV sets. When he wrote his "fictional" story, he was unconsciously drawing from the real, lurking presence in Watashuka's electrical systems. Melissa Young’s disappearance was tied to this, as she encountered the entity during her final broadcast. Now, the entity has started to stir again, using television broadcasts to influence and manipulate people through fear.
---
### **Key Locations and Encounters**
1. **The Hut**:
    - Players can visit _The Hut_ and question Buzz Horton. They notice a variety of old, retro TV sets gathering dust in the back. Buzz is reluctant to talk about the returns but eventually admits that some customers have returned sets, claiming they see strange figures or hear whispers when the TVs are on, even when unplugged.
    - Upon inspecting one of the returned TVs, the players experience static interference and brief, disturbing images of a shadowy figure twisting in and out of various TV programs, much like the repairman from Alan’s story.
2. **Alan’s Dorm Room**:
    - If the players confront Alan again, he admits that ever since writing the story, he’s been having nightmares and seeing static-filled TV screens in his dreams. He doesn’t know how his story connected to Melissa’s, but something about the radio station feels wrong. He mentions hearing strange noises the last time he visited WCTU to drop off a new script.
3. **WCTU Station**:
    - When the players investigate WCTU, they can find old tapes from Melissa’s broadcasts. Replaying her final show, they’ll hear her voice growing frantic toward the end before her chilling final words: _"He’s here... inside..."_
    - While at the station, the players may experience unexplained static on the monitors, flickering lights, and brief, unnerving glimpses of a shadowy figure on an old TV set in the corner of the room.
---
### **Climactic Encounter**
The final confrontation occurs at _The Hut_ after hours. The players learn that one of the returned TVs is still "active" and must be destroyed before the entity fully manifests. Buzz mentions that this particular TV came from a customer near Lakeview Shores who disappeared under strange circumstances. When they attempt to destroy the TV, it begins broadcasting disturbing images of themselves—warped and twisted versions of their own lives.
As they try to stop the TV, the entity that Melissa saw and Alan wrote about finally manifests through the screen. The shadowy figure—an echo of the TV repairman—attempts to pull the players into a nightmare world inside the television broadcast. The players must use their wits and knowledge of the occult to sever the connection between the cursed TVs and the eldritch presence before they too become part of the programming.
---
### **Aftermath and Potential Hooks**
- **Alan Sanders’ Fate**: If the players succeed, Alan is freed from the nightmare influence of his story. He may remain in Watashuka, grateful but haunted by what he inadvertently unleashed. If they fail, Alan could fall deeper into the occult mystery, either as an ally or a pawn for future adventures.
- **The Hut**: Buzz Horton may continue to unknowingly stock cursed electronics, or he may become a key source of occult information for the players, as the cursed TVs are revealed to be part of a larger, more sinister conspiracy tied to the town’s electronics infrastructure.
- **WCTU’s Dark Secrets**: The players may choose to investigate more about WCTU, especially as rumors of Melissa’s disappearance and the cursed broadcasts grow. Could the station itself be a focal point for occult manipulation, or is something even darker lurking in the static between shows?
## Details
### Melissa's Story: "The TV Repairman"
**Summary**:  
Melissa's original story, written during her freshman year, was about a seemingly ordinary TV repairman who used his job to scope out homes for theft. After robbing one of his customers, he was eventually caught and sent to prison. The story ended with his arrest and the reassurance that justice had been served, with no supernatural or eerie elements. It was a straightforward crime tale, with the focus on the repairman’s moral downfall and his comeuppance.
---
### The New Story: "Inside the Screen"
**Summary**:  
The new story, written by a sophomore named **Alan Sanders**, picks up years after the events of Melissa’s original work. The TV repairman, now out of prison, seeks revenge on his former customers. However, the repairman doesn’t physically return to their homes—instead, he becomes part of the TV programming. His presence warps the content, turning commercials and shows into horrific parodies. One by one, his victims experience disturbing, nightmarish visions on their screens. At first, they believe it's part of the broadcast, but the terror escalates until the repairman finally learns how to scare them to death, feeding off their fear.
---
### Author of the New Story: Alan Sanders
Alan Sanders, a quiet and creative sophomore at Caroline College, has a talent for writing eerie and unsettling stories. He frequently contributes to "Mystery Hour" and had no knowledge of Melissa's earlier work. Despite this, his story was an uncanny continuation of her original TV repairman tale. Alan claimed the idea came to him in a dream, but the perfect alignment with Melissa's work was too strange to be a coincidence. His writing style blends dark humor with psychological horror, making him a favorite among listeners of the program.
---
### Melissa's Last Words on Air
After reading Alan’s story during her final broadcast, Melissa closed with these unsettling words:
_"You think the repairman’s gone, but he never really left, did he? He’s still out there, crawling into places he shouldn’t be. It’s not always a TV—it could be anything, really. The walls... the wires... even right here, inside the station. He’s watching... waiting..."_
At first, the audience believed Melissa was merely adding her own spooky twist to the story. But her tone shifted, the fear in her voice palpable as she whispered her final words:
_"Oh God, he's... he's here. He’s inside..."_
Then the transmission cut off, leaving dead air. The listeners assumed it was a technical glitch, but Melissa was never seen again.
---
### What Did Melissa See?
In her final moments, Melissa noticed something strange with the station’s equipment. The static on the monitors, the flickering of lights, and an eerie distortion in the soundboard made her realize that something—or someone—was manipulating the broadcast from within the station. As she pieced it together, she glanced at one of the old, unused TV sets in the station’s storage room. There, distorted on the flickering screen, was the faint, shadowy figure of a man—the TV repairman, watching her through the glass.
That’s when she knew she wasn’t alone.

**Role in the Setting:**  
Nyarlathotep, the "Crawling Chaos," is a malevolent cosmic entity known for taking many forms and directly interacting with mortals. Unlike [[Shub-Niggurath]] and [[Yog-Sothoth]], who rarely interact directly, Nyarlathotep delights in manipulating humans, sowing discord and chaos. He has been pulling the strings in Watashuka since its founding, subtly influencing both the original occultists who established **Prairieville Academy** and the ongoing activities of the cults.
Nyarlathotep is the true force behind much of the supernatural activity in the region. He enjoys playing the cults against each other, allowing them to believe they are following separate paths to summon the "original god," when in reality, they are all serving his greater agenda. His ultimate goal is chaos, destruction, and the collapse of human society through their own hubris.
**Manipulating the Cults:**  
Nyarlathotep has been guiding both the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]** and the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]**, ensuring that their rituals continue while keeping them in conflict. He takes on various forms to influence key figures in [[Watashuka]], sometimes posing as government agents or college officials to steer events in his favor.
- **Divide and Conquer:** Nyarlathotep fosters conflict between the cults, ensuring they remain distracted by their rivalry rather than focusing on the true nature of their "god."
- **Direct Manipulation:** Nyarlathotep occasionally appears to cult leaders in visions or dreams, providing them with just enough knowledge to keep their rituals progressing while hiding the full consequences of their actions.
**Ultimate Goal:**  
Nyarlathotep’s endgame is to unleash Cthulhu and other Great Old Ones by ensuring that the cults’ final ritual in 1987 succeeds—though not in the way they expect. He knows that summoning these beings will lead to mass destruction, and he relishes the chaos that will ensue. Unlike the other entities, Nyarlathotep has no desire for a structured outcome—he simply wants to watch the world burn.

**Role in the Setting:**  
Shub-Niggurath, known as the "Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young," is a cosmic entity associated with fertility, nature, and monstrous offspring. In [[Watashuka]], Shub-Niggurath's influence is primarily felt through the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]**, which arose from the failed occult attempts at **Prairieville Academy** in the mid-19th century. The cult believes that by manipulating the ley lines' natural energy and performing rituals involving human fertility, they can summon Shub-Niggurath to bless the world with her "young"—mutant creatures that will reshape reality.
The cult’s rituals often involve pregnant women, tapping into the natural forces of growth and transformation. They believe that human fertility, when augmented by ley line power, can give birth to something greater—monstrous offspring capable of bending nature and reality to the cult's will. These rituals have intensified since the 1980s, with the cult using the local teaching hospital as a cover for their experiments, often targeting vulnerable women or those in desperate need of care.
**Goals and Influence:**  
Shub-Niggurath’s primary goal is to spread her influence across the world through her offspring, creating grotesque new forms of life that defy the natural order. The **Church of the Delayed Blossom** believes they are nurturing these creatures to prepare for a time when Shub-Niggurath will emerge fully, reshaping Watashuka and, eventually, the world.
- **Corrupting Nature:** Through Shub-Niggurath's influence, nature itself begins to turn hostile. Infected animals, monstrous flora, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns all signal her growing presence.
- **Pregnant Women as Vessels:** The cult uses rituals that involve pregnant women to create hybrid creatures. Their goal is to birth powerful beings that will carry out Shub-Niggurath’s will.
**Key Locations:**
- **Luttermoser Science Hall**: Some of the cult’s experiments are conducted here, masked as medical research.
- Sister Sarah's Teaching Hospital:

**Connection to Other Entities:**  
Shub-Niggurath’s influence over nature contrasts with the temporal and dimensional control sought by **[[Yog-Sothoth]]**. While the cults of the two entities sometimes clash, they also occasionally collaborate when their goals align, particularly when it comes to opening gateways that benefit both their agendas. The **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled** occasionally aids the Church of the Delayed Blossom in finding ley line nodes, but both believe their paths are the true route to summoning the "original god."

**Role in the Setting:**  
Yog-Sothoth is the "Lurker at the Threshold," a being of unfathomable knowledge who exists outside of time and space. Yog-Sothoth’s influence in [[Watashuka]] is channeled through the **[[Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled]]**, which emerged after the destruction of **Prairieville Academy**. The Brotherhood believes that by controlling time and opening dimensional gates, they can commune directly with Yog-Sothoth and ultimately summon him into the material world. They view him as a key to unlocking the mysteries of existence and gaining ultimate power.
The cult, especially active during the 1980s, conducts experiments with ley lines, seeking to manipulate time and open dimensional rifts. These experiments have resulted in dangerous phenomena, such as time loops and pockets of altered reality around Caroline College. **[[Project Caroline]]**, rebooted in secret by the government, unknowingly collaborates with Yog-Sothoth’s cult by conducting similar experiments on time manipulation.
**Goals and Influence:**  
Yog-Sothoth's followers seek to break the barriers between dimensions, allowing their god to enter the material world. They believe that control over time will grant them the ability to transcend mortality and reshape the world to their vision.
- **Time Loops and Dimensional Gates:** The Brotherhood’s rituals are focused on bending time and opening gateways to other realities. They hope to control these gates to bring Yog-Sothoth into this dimension.
- **The Time Loop:** A side effect of their rituals is the accidental creation of a **time loop** from 1983 to 1987, trapping many individuals, including **Dr. Amy Mann**, within a repeating cycle of events. The cult views this loop as a necessary phase of their greater plan, believing that mastery over the loop will give them control over time itself.
**Key Locations:**
- **Qubit Tower at Caroline College:** The supercomputers in this building play a key role in the cult’s manipulation of time, serving as a hub for their experiments.
- **Castelaz Building (Physical Sciences):** The Brotherhood conducts its dimensional experiments here under the guise of scientific research.
**Connection to Other Entities:**  
Yog-Sothoth is often in opposition to **[[Shub-Niggurath]]**, as the nature-focused rituals of the **[[Church of the Delayed Blossom]]** interfere with the temporal and dimensional work of the **Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled**. However, both cults occasionally collaborate, particularly when it comes to rituals involving ley lines, though they believe they are summoning different aspects of the "original god."

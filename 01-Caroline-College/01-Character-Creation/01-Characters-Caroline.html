<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p><strong>This is a game of horror. Some themes may be disturbing to some players. Players are required to engage with the Session Zero to ensure that the game is appropriate for themselves, all players, and the keeper at the table.</strong></p>
<p><em>Please note: this game makes creative use of organizations that exist in real life. This game is set in an alternate history and the inclusion of these peoples, the Ho-Chunk, the Amish and the Lutherans, are here for verisimilitude. I have learned much about these peoples during the creation of this setting and have nothing but respect for their culture. I have taken efforts to avoid working in their unique mythologies into this game. I am not versed enough in these histories to do justice to such an endeavor. Any facsimile to real people, real events or histories is purely coincide.</em></p>

<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<h3>Determining Character Stats</h3>
<h4>Rolling and Distributing Characteristics</h4>
<p>For <strong>Caroline College</strong>, we use a variant of for determining characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Roll 9 sets of (3d4+2)</strong> and assign one of the nine sets to each of the following:
<ul>
<li>Strength (<strong>STR</strong>)</li>
<li>Constitution (<strong>CON</strong>)</li>
<li>Dexterity (<strong>DEX</strong>)</li>
<li>Appearance (<strong>APP</strong>)</li>
<li>Power (<strong>POW</strong>)</li>
<li>Luck (<strong>LUCK</strong>)</li>
<li>Size (<strong>SIZ</strong>)</li>
<li>Intelligence (<strong>INT</strong>)</li>
<li>Education (<strong>EDU</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following standard Call of Cthulhu procedure, each value will be multiplied by 5 to determine the characteristic's value. 1/2 and 1/5 values can be determined from this value (except for Luck).</p>
<p>The goal with this system of generating characteristics is to provide a reasonable floor for character stats and a realistic upper end (you are students after all) that allows for growth throughout the campaign. Within this setting, there are numerous ways to gain increases to characters or bonuses.</p>
<h2>House Rules</h2>
<p>There are a number of house rules used in this campaign setting, including optional ones.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../01-Caroline-College/02-Setting-Rules/01-House-Rule-Distress-Points-(DSP)" class="internal alias" data-slug="01-Caroline-College/02-Setting-Rules/01-House-Rule-Distress-Points-(DSP)">Optional House Rule: Distress Points</a></li>
<li><a href="../../01-Caroline-College/02-Setting-Rules/02-House-Rule-School-Life" class="internal alias" data-slug="01-Caroline-College/02-Setting-Rules/02-House-Rule-School-Life">House Rule: School Life</a></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Mechanics Adjustments</h2>
<p>The following are a list of adjustments, clarifications, and exercised options available in the Call Of Cthulhu system that are made use of in Caroline College.</p>
<h3>Sanity Loss Adjustments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading Mythos Tomes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Costs sanity but <strong>will not trigger bouts of madness or insanity</strong> if done in a safe environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recovery from Indefinite Insanity</h3>
<p>Students at Caroline College have access to <strong>counseling sessions</strong> provided by the local Lutheran church. These sessions are non-religious and aim to aid students in recovering from indefinite insanity and trauma.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly Counseling Sessions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Once per week, when not participating in a game session. This is the same as Call of Cthulhu recovery method in all ways except the frequency (weekly as opposed to monthly).</li>
<li><strong>Sanity Recovery Mechanics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery Attempt</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Roll percentile dice (1d100).</li>
<li>On a result of <strong>01â95</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Success</strong>: Recover <strong>1d10 Sanity Points</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a result of <strong>96â100</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Setback</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lose <strong>1d6 Sanity Points</strong>.</li>
<li>Gain a <strong>new phobia</strong> related to the stress or topics discussed during counseling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resolving Indefinite Insanity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If Sanity Points are gained during a counseling session, you may immediately make a Sanity check (using your updated Sanity score).</li>
<li>On a <strong>Hard Success</strong>, your indefinite insanity is resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Commitment</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Attending a counseling session requires an in-game time slot, potentially conflicting with classes or investigations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keeper's Note</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Frequent therapy sessions may draw attention or have narrative implications, adding to the tension of balancing time.</li>
<li><strong>Failed Therapy Sessions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>May induce phobias related to the therapy content, providing additional story hooks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Luck Recovery and Advancement</h3>
<p><strong>Luck advancements</strong> are made at the <strong>start of every game session</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Luck Recovery Mechanics</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Improvement Check</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Roll 1d100.</li>
<li>If the roll is <strong>above</strong> your current Luck, add <strong>1d10 points</strong>.</li>
<li>If the roll is equal to or less than your current Luck, no points are recovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Luck may not exceed 99.</li>
<li>The starting Luck value is not used again in the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skill Advancements</h3>
<p><strong>Skill advancements</strong> are made after thematically appropriate breaks, as determined by the keeper (expect <strong>3â5 per semester, including exams</strong>).</p>
<h3>PvP Interactions and Loss of Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player vs. Player (PvP) 'Attacks'</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Must be made with <strong>consent</strong> of all involved players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Control Situations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Occur when a character is under the effects of insanity, a Breakdown due to Distress, or certain supernatural influences.</li>
<li>Actions are at the keeper's discretion.</li>
<li>The keeper should consider player enjoyment and strive for consensual storytelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backstory Connections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robust and Thematically Appropriate Backstories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Include one or more entries with a <strong>dark element</strong>.</li>
<li>Develop meaningful locations, significant people, and pivotal events that add depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Character Connections</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Every character must have a connection to <strong>at least two other characters</strong> in the party in their backstory.</li>
<li>No character can have more than two connections to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Group Skill Checks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assisting with Skill Rolls</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If more than one character attempts a skill roll for the same task, under pressure:
<ul>
<li>If at least <strong>two characters have skill above baseline</strong>, one person can make the roll with a <strong>Bonus Die</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spending Luck</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Luck Points</strong> can be spent to alter the result of a skill or characteristic roll on a <strong>1-for-1 basis</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Cannot spend Luck on:
<ul>
<li>Luck rolls</li>
<li>Damage rolls</li>
<li>Sanity rolls</li>
<li>Rolls to determine the amount of Sanity points lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cannot spend Luck on <strong>Pushed Rolls</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Critical, Fumbles, and Firearm Malfunctions</strong> cannot be altered with Luck.</li>
<li><strong>No skill improvement check</strong> is earned if Luck was used to alter the roll.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Character Creation Advice</h2>
<p>This section is not about rule modifications or clarifications. Instead, it is advice for how to get the most out of your character's time at Caroline College. Every setting has tropes and archetypes and a game set in the early 80's in the Midwest of the United States is no different. So here is some advise for making characters that fit the feel of Caroline College.</p>
<h3>Hopefuls, Not Heroes.</h3>
<p>This is a story of people who got in over their heads and either rose to the occasion or failed in the most memorable way possible. Is it possible to make a character that has millions of dollars in assets available to them, the ears of kings and presidents, and was a former super solider work in the setting? Maybe. Would it <a href="../../00-Gaming-Thoughts/!How-I-Play#respecting-the-mood" class="internal alias" data-slug="00-Gaming-Thoughts/!How-I-Play">respect the mood</a> of the setting. Absolutely not.</p>
<h4>Character Ideas and Suggestions For Players Who Don't Know Where To Start</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get Dirty:</strong> Remember that this is a horror game with a setting that assumes <strong>no one</strong> is pure and innocent. Everyone in Watashuka has a skeleton in their closet; even you. The size of this skeleton, and how far back in the closet it is, is up to you; but its there. For some it might be minor and public; youthful drug use that left a mark on you that you don't deny, a problem with juvie as a child that you'd rather not talk about, something.
<ul>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Because just like a fantasy game where your character is expected to take wounds and recover, a horror game inflicts wounds too. But when those wound happen, it is more interesting, and hopefully fun, to have a way to show those wounds by more than a number in a box. Call of Cthulhu works best when the backstory is the most important page on the character sheet. As horrors rend your mind, your backstory changes. New facts become 'discovered' about your past. It is much more meaningful to have a fertile bed ready for this than just a blank sheet and rolled phobia.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT USE THE GAME AS THERAPY.</strong> It is tempting for some people to use real life, lived pain, as a basis for a character's backstory. Don't do this. We are gamers, not therapists. While it may be cathartic for you, it is not for your fellow table-mates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ask before touching:</strong> The NPCs in the setting can be a great way of tying your character into the setting early on. While we have tried to add dozens and dozens of NPCs that you might know, some of these NPCs have backstories of their own. Work with the Keeper BEFORE fleshing out an elaborate back story involving you being the long lost child of an NPCs who never had children. By asking first, the Keeper can help find an appropriate way to tie you into the game. They may even be able to help you weave new lore of the world!</li>
<li><strong>Don't Be Afraid To Be New:</strong> The College actively recruits people from outside the region. Maybe you have no ties to the region. Maybe you are here as a last resort - the failing student who got a surprise full-ride scholarship to a little school in the middle of nowhere. Or perhaps you are running from something back home, something you would like to stay far away. Work with your Keeper as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Don't 'Cheat':</strong> &quot;<em>Well, my character has connection to X so I should already know all about Y and Z.</em>&quot;. Or &quot;<em>I'm the Q's daughter so I should be able to just walk into the secret meeting.</em>&quot; This is a game of horror and horror means the unknown. Don't try to engineer a character that takes the fun out of the horror but circumventing it. We aren't here to 'win', we are here to play.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace The Unknown:</strong> If you are at Caroline College, you deserve to be at Caroline College. Rise above the madness by investigating it.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Example Starting Points For Characters</h5>
<p>If you need them, take inspiration from the following. Mix, match, ignore, add to, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small-Town Legacy</strong> â A freshman who grew up hearing stories of their uncle's disappearance while working the night shift at <em><a href="../../01-Caroline-College/03-The-College/01-Locations/WCTU" class="internal" data-slug="01-Caroline-College/03-The-College/01-Locations/WCTU">WCTU</a></em> (notice all the hosts that are 'replacements'). Theyâre studying journalism, determined to find out what happened, but their family warns them against digging too deep.</li>
<li><strong>New School, New Dreams, right?</strong>: Maybe if I leave the state the dreams will stop. Maybe I won't drop out my first semester, again. Maybe a psychology major will help me remember the dreams I can't recall. Maybe it will help me forget them altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Amateur Cryptid Hunter</strong> â A kid who grew up on Ripley's and &quot;In Search Of...&quot;.  Fascinated by rumors of cryptid sightings around Lake Geneva and Watashuka decides to major in biology to see if its even possible.</li>
<li><strong>The Journalistâs ProtÃ©gÃ©</strong> â A journalism major with a passion for uncovering the truth. They landed an early internship at <em>The Prairie Press</em> under <a href="../../01-Caroline-College/04-Watashuka/02-People/Norm-Habersham" class="internal alias" data-slug="01-Caroline-College/04-Watashuka/02-People/Norm-Habersham">Norm Habersham</a>, but they've started to receive strange anonymous tips and can't shake the feeling theyâre being watched.</li>
<li><strong>The Former Delinquent</strong> â Fresh out of high school, you barely scraped into college after a troubled past at North High (how did that happen). Youâre trying to start fresh, but a broken home is hard to over come. Especially with spending all your life hearing hints that mom and dad knew more about what went down at South High that night.</li>
<li><strong>The Reluctant Believer</strong> â A history major, raised by a strict religious family, who grew up hearing warnings about occult forces infiltrating Caroline College. Not a founding member, but a passionate one, your grandfather made sure you heard all of <a href="../../01-Caroline-College/05-Factions/Mothers-Opposing-Metal" class="internal alias" data-slug="01-Caroline-College/05-Factions/Mothers-Opposing-Metal">Mothers Opposing Metal's</a> warnings. But now that you are on campus, you canât help but notice strange things, particularly in St. Johnâs Chapel, that remind you of his warnings.</li>
<li><strong>The Absent Minded Pre-Med Student?</strong> â You've always been drawn to medicine, and was a promising student. But now that you are on campus it seems you can't remember where you put your stuff. And there must be allergies in your dorm because you wake up with nose bleeds... a lot.</li>
<li><strong>The Photographer with a Problem</strong> â A freshman art major with a passion for photography. Maybe the school will help you go to the next level... and finally learn how to stop getting that odd light smudge that sometimes show up in your pictures when you take photos of certain places.</li>
<li><strong>Maybe Dad Was Right</strong> â The child of a longtime Watashuka resident, you grew up hearing stories about strange happenings around Lake Mary, particularly from your eccentric family members. Now that youâre attending Caroline College, youâre starting to wonder if those stories might be more than just local myths.</li>
<li><strong>Absentee Grandfather</strong> - You are here. Therefore, you had a father. That's just science right? And that means he had a father; it follows. Then why is the last mention of my grandfather, anywhere in town, a baptism record from before WW2?</li>
<li><strong>The Hesitant Explorer</strong> â An outdoor enthusiast who joined Caroline Collegeâs Adventure Club, eager to explore the forests around the town. Maybe you'll get a chance to see the creature that licked your palm clean of blood when you feel down that ravine when you were a kid. Too bad the scout guides scared it away before you could see more than its tongue.</li>
<li><strong>The Quiet Music Major</strong> â Drawn to the <em>Don Peachy Center for the Performing Arts</em>, you quickly discover that perfect pitch doesn't mean that someone in in your head telling you what to play when under stress.</li>

<h3>Backstory Elements</h3>
<p>Developing a rich backstory adds depth to your character and enhances the gaming experience. Each character should create entries for the following areas, aiming for meaningful and engaging content. This is a horror game, so dark elements within a backstory is acceptable, thematically appropriate, and strongly encouraged (within the limits defined by Session Zero). Try to remember that your characters don't know what's happening in the setting yet; hints and suggestions go a long way!</p>
<h4>Ideology/Beliefs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Example</strong>: &quot;I believe in justice.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's bad</em>: Too vague and generic; lacks depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable Example</strong>: &quot;I believe that the legal system is flawed, and true justice can only be achieved outside of it.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's acceptable</em>: Adds complexity and hints at potential conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Good Example</strong>: &quot;Ethan prowls the city's backstreets at night, where justice rarely reaches. When the courts failed him and the guilty walked free, he wasn't above bending the rules to set things right. To him, the law is just a guideline, and true justice sometimes requires a darker path that others might deem questionable.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's good</em>: Provides depth, aligns with game themes, and introduces moral ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Significant People</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Example</strong>: &quot;My mother.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's bad</em>: Too general; doesn't explain significance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable Example</strong>: &quot;My mother, who supported my academic pursuits.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's acceptable</em>: Offers context but lacks depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Good Example</strong>: &quot;Amelia carries a tattered letter from her estranged mother, filled with unsent words of apology. She reads it under dim lamplight, wondering about the life her mother chose over her family. Each word fuels Amelia's resolve to find her, not just to reconnect, but to understand the choices that led them apart.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's good</em>: Adds personal stakes, urgency, and ties to potential plot lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meaningful Locations</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Example</strong>: &quot;The park.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's bad</em>: Too vague; lacks meaningful context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable Example</strong>: &quot;The old park near my childhood home where I used to play.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's acceptable</em>: Provides some context but lacks depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Good Example</strong>: &quot;The rusted remains of the old Ferris wheel loom over the deserted fairground, a place where Lucas once shared a fleeting moment of joy with his first love before she moved away without a word. He returns there, the silence heavy with memories and unanswered questions, hoping one day to recapture that lost connection or at least find closure.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's good</em>: Rich atmosphere, ties into supernatural elements, and profoundly impacts the character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Treasured Possessions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Example</strong>: &quot;A book.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's bad</em>: Generic; doesn't reveal anything about the character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable Example</strong>: &quot;An old diary from my grandmother.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's acceptable</em>: Provides a familial connection but could be more detailed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Good Example</strong>: &quot;Lily discovered an old, leather-bound book hidden behind a loose brick in her grandmother's fireplace. The pages are filled with faded handwriting and strange symbols she doesn't understand. As she reads, unsettling family secrets begin to surfaceâstories of forgotten ancestors and choices that cast long shadows over her family's history, secrets they had tried desperately to keep buried. At least she knows she isn't alone in her bad choices.&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Why it's good</em>: Deeply personal, tied to game lore, and serves as a catalyst for adventures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Niisii</h1></div></div><article class="popover-hint"><h1>What was and what will be Niisii?</h1>
<p>Niisii is the world I have spend the most time on, and know the least about. This is because it started as one thing; something good. And that good thing got morphed into something else. This new thing was good but it was never 'right'. It was forced into being something it was not supposed to be. And because it wasn't fit for this new purpose it broke.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>No, there is too much. Let me sum up.</p>
<p>Niisii was built at the request of a group of adult friends who gamed. This group of friends engaged in alternative lifestyles and activities. They a small request. &quot;Could we make a world where heteronormality and monogamy were NOT the default setting?&quot;</p>
<p>My answer was Niisii.</p>
<p>Sexuality, like in the real world, was a driving force in the world. The game was not erotic, but it was mature. The themes were heavy and tried to be thoughtful. The quests had more to do with human desire and fault (regardless of the species) than McGuffins and loot.</p>
<p>Stories were told, laughs were bellowed and tears were shed.</p>
<p>The DM was doing his job.</p>
<p>But as it happens, within the group there was a tiff. Someone in the group felt slighted and the games stopped because we all felt bad. And like that, Niisii was put on a shelf.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Fast forward</p>
<p>Years and passed and a new group of friend have formed. And they wanted a homebrew world to play in. FR is fun and all but ....</p>
<p><em>'Sure! When do you want to start playing?'</em></p>
<p><strong>Tonight!</strong></p>
<p>Ok, it <em>was</em> a few days later. But with work and life, what difference was 30-40 hours going to make.</p>
<p>So I dusted off an old friend and unlikely heroes went off to find a missing librarian.</p>
<p>Niisii was always built to support multiple DMs; a measure of design went into the world so that different people had their own 'corners' of the world with just enough connections to make it feel 'whole'. So, for this group, I found an area where the lore was ignored and started to tell stories appropriate to this group.</p>
<p>And then it grew.</p>
<p>Slowly, what made Niisii, <strong>Niisii</strong> was being pushed out in favor of 'generica'. Every race had to make an appearance, the world was always coming to the end, and no one wanted to go questing for love or vanity.</p>
<p>Another +5 sword would do just nicely thank you.</p>
<p>And of course, whatever came out in the latest book by WotC had to be rolled in.</p>
<p>Stories were told, laughs were bellowed and tears were shed.</p>
<p>The DM was doing his job. :-D</p>
<p>And not just the starting DM. Other DMs joined. And they told their stories too.</p>
<p>And each story moved the world further away from its flavor. Mechanics, lore, limitations and options were stripped to make room for the latest suppliment.</p>
<p>Sure, there were are few that wanted see what this 'old' Niisii was like but what do you mean my elf would live as long as my current 5e character?</p>
<p>Niisii was generic.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, we had <strong>a lot</strong> of fun in this world. Hundreds of years of history, epic stories, and games where, no exaggeration, over 20 people playing together in person (remember that!) just share in the stories.</p>
<p>To be fair that was <strong>only</strong> two or three times.</p>
<p>....the average game night was over 12.</p>
<p>And the games happened multiple times a week.</p>
<p>Epic</p>
<p>But it wasn't Niisii.</p>
<p>It wasn't a world built where a group of lovely, good hearted perverts, could tell stories of love and betrayal. All in a world where they weren't the freaks. Where they weren't the ones who had to hide who or how they loved. Where they had representation. Their lore and stories were ... different. And when their lore got in the way, it was erased. Not added to. Erased.</p>
<p>But with that said, it was <strong>not</strong> the games played in Niisii, nor the people who played them, that was the problem.</p>
<p>It was me.</p>
<p>I led people into this wonderful garden of joy. They didn't want to be <em>there</em>. They just wanted to play games. And if this was the world they had, well they would make a home for themselves here. They plowed the ground so they could plant their seeds. They did the right thing for them.</p>
<p>If I hadn't of been lazy, I would have made a world fit for them. It would have been something... sturdy. Every garden can be full of joy and no better than another. Just grow the garden that fits you!</p>
<p>As it is, Niisii lays in shambles. It doesn't 'feel' right anymore; at least not to its father.</p>
<p>Am I teary eyed sometimes about a make believe world?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, not for the world. For the why, and the who, it was made for.</p>
<p>Will I 'fix' Niisii someday?</p>
<p>I don't know. I doubt it. But I am often wrong.</p>
<p>What I do know is that maybe I'm beginning to learn a lesson. Knowing when to build new gardens and when to tend the old ones is something I hope to get good at in the next 100-200 years. :-)</p>
<p><em>Then why is this here?</em></p>
<p><em>To remind me of my mantra.</em>

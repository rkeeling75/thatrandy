							<h2>Welcome to my table</h2>
							<p>A Guide For People Looking To Play At A Table With Me</p>
						</header>
						<div>							
							<h2 data-heading="What is this" dir="auto">What is this</h2>
							<p dir="auto">This document is living and will be adjusted as my views grow and change. I have gamed for many decades and the only constant I have seen is change.</p>
							<p dir="auto">The following are my ideas and are focused mainly on players who have never played with me before. Your ideas about games and how they should be played may differ and that's great! The hope with this document is to see if we are compatible with each in terms of gaming. I believe strongly in the idea that not every table is right for every person.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Introduction" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
							<p dir="auto">Role-playing games are for everyone, but not every game table is the right fit for every player. My goal is to create collaborative stories, where everyone helps drive the narrative. We all work together to build a fun and memorable experience. Below is a guide to help you understand the expectations and style of games I run.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Session Zero" dir="auto">Session Zero</h2>
							<p dir="auto">We will always begin new campaigns with a <strong>Session Zero</strong> to align expectations, discuss boundaries, and establish the tone. There are two types of session zeros:</p>
							<ol>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Established World</strong>: If we are playing in a defined setting, I will provide information about the world and its tone ahead of time. During Session Zero, we’ll discuss how your character fits into this world and make sure everyone is aligned on tone and boundaries. There is still a lot of flexibility available to us to tweak existing worlds to taste.</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>New Campaign Setting</strong>: If we’re starting a new campaign world, we’ll collaboratively build the world together. This is your chance to influence the setting, tone, and major elements. Be ready to share your ideas and preferences, so we can create a world that fits your expectations.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2 data-heading="Character Creation" dir="auto">Character Creation</h2>
							<p dir="auto">Character creation is a crucial part of any game, and we’ll handle this during Session Zero. Here’s what to keep in mind:</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Backstories</strong>: Characters should not start as heroes; they are on the path to becoming heroes. Focus on creating backstories that plant seeds for future adventures, rather than ones where your character has already achieved greatness. Try not to come to the table with concrete notions about a character. The best characters are created within the context of a party.</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Fitting the Tone</strong>: Your character should fit the theme of the campaign. If we’re playing a gritty, combat-heavy game, a pacifist may not work. If the game is about exploration, make sure your character is ready to explore.</li>
							</ul>
							<p dir="auto">-<strong>Party Dynamics</strong>: We are playing games with a party, not individuals. Try to make a character that is interesting to you <strong>and</strong> fits in with the party. One way of doing this is making sure that your characters has a strong connection to <strong>at least</strong> one other character in the party.</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>'Evil' Characters</strong>: If you’re playing a <em>morally gray</em> character, ensure there is something that keeps you tied to the party. Conflicts within the party are fine if they create story opportunities but avoid actions that ruin the game for other players. And don't be surprised that actions have consequences. Murder hobos become the target for another party's quest.  </li>
							</ul>
							<h2 data-heading="Respecting the Mood" dir="auto">Respecting the Mood</h2>
							<p dir="auto">Mood is everything! Respecting the tone and mood of the game is important. Avoid breaking tension or stepping outside the genre we’ve agreed upon. For example:</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">Cracking jokes during an emotional scene can spoil the immersion.</li>
								<li dir="auto">Refusing to engage with core themes, such as exploration or combat, might disrupt the game.</li>
							</ul>
							<blockquote dir="auto">
								<p>Even hobbits go on adventures</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p dir="auto">We’re here to build a story together, and maintaining the right tone helps everyone stay immersed.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="House Rules and Rule of Cool" dir="auto">House Rules and Rule of Cool</h2>
							<p dir="auto">I follow the <strong>Rule of Cool</strong>—the story always comes before the rules. While we’ll try to follow the game system's rule, if strict rule-following slows down the game or takes away from the story, we’ll prioritize the narrative.</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>House Rules</strong>: These are generally aimed at speeding up gameplay or making things run smoother. For example, detailed combat rules might be simplified to keep the story moving. </li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Rules Lawyers</strong>: If you enjoy debating game mechanics, my games may not be the best fit for you. I prefer to focus on storytelling and improvisation. If you must debate the rules, with people that enjoy that type of thing, do so AFTER the session. </li>
							</ul>
							<h2 data-heading="Improvisation and Player Agency" dir="auto">Improvisation and Player Agency</h2>
							<p dir="auto">My games involve <strong>a lot of improvisation</strong>. Your actions will heavily influence the story’s direction, and major events will only occur if the antagonists can counter your actions. It’s entirely possible for you to derail or even prevent major, planned events through clever choices. I write stories based on plans and locations, not end goals. So if you are looking to 'win' a story then I am not the storyteller for you.</p>
							<blockquote dir="auto">
								<p>Modules are inspiration, not recipes. </p>
							</blockquote>
							<p dir="auto">Creativity is always rewarded, even if the payoff isn’t immediate. Feel free to try unconventional actions—negotiating with an enemy, coming up with new uses for spells, or devising clever solutions to problems. While not every move will work as intended, it will always shape the story in meaningful ways.</p>
							<p dir="auto">Unless planned for during session zero, not every encounter is balanced. Sometimes the best choice is to not engage.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Player Preparation" dir="auto">Player Preparation</h2>
							<p dir="auto">To help keep the story flowing, here are a few tips:</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Be Attentive</strong>: Stay engaged with the game, listen to other players, and make notes if needed.</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Review Between Sessions</strong>: Before each session, review your notes to refresh yourself on the story and prepare for what’s ahead.</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Stay Curious</strong>: Keep your character curious and involved in the world—ask questions, explore, and look for ways to engage with the narrative.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2 data-heading="Safety Tools" dir="auto">Safety Tools</h2>
							<p dir="auto">Given the mature themes often present in my games, <strong>player safety is a top priority</strong>. I use tools such as the <strong>'X' card</strong> and <strong>consent flowers</strong> to ensure everyone feels comfortable.</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">
									<strong>Session Zero</strong>: we will establish the comfort levels for different topics. This is a proactive step to ensure that everyone is playing the game we want to play. You have to speak up for your preferences to be respected.
									<ul>
										<li dir="auto"><strong>Lines &amp; Veils</strong>: Lines are hard limits that you do not want to see in the game, veils are things that can come up but you do not wish to have it in the spot light. These limits can apply differently for PCs and NPCs. It might be a hard limit, a line, for the PCs to commit murder, but not for an evil NPCs (thus giving a reason for the players to stop them!).</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>X Card</strong>: If at any time you feel uncomfortable with the content, you can tap the X card to indicate we need to stop and change the topic immediately. It’s a disruption, but your safety is more important than the flow of the game.</li>
								<li dir="auto">
									<strong>Consent 'Flowers'</strong>: A more subtle tool, consent flowers let you indicate your comfort level with the game in a non-verbal manner. Items will be provided that can be place in front of you in order to communicate your current comfort level.
									<ul>
										<li dir="auto"><strong>Green</strong>: You’re fine, keep going.</li>
										<li dir="auto"><strong>Yellow</strong>: Proceed with caution.</li>
										<li dir="auto"><strong>Red</strong>: Please change the subject or theme.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p dir="auto">Consent Flowers can be thought of as precursors to the X card.</p>
							<p dir="auto">If possible, try to raise concerns during Session Zero. It helps me tailor the game, and it gives you the ability to consent to the story’s direction. </p>
							<p dir="auto">Always assume that people are acting in good faith. Most people do not want to harm someone else; mistakes can happen. The best solution is <strong>always</strong> open and proactive communication. Everyone at the table is human and misunderstandings can happen. So it is on each person to help your fellow table-mates if they begin to stray from the agreed upon limits.</p>
							<h3 data-heading="Common Topics to Discuss" dir="auto">Common Topics to Discuss</h3>
							<p dir="auto">From <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.dramadice.com/gm-tips/safety-tools-for-tabletop-rpgs/" target="_blank">https://www.dramadice.com/gm-tips/safety-tools-for-tabletop-rpgs/</a> </p>
							<h4 data-heading="Frequently 'Lined' Topics:" dir="auto">Frequently 'Lined' Topics:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">Sexualized violence</li>
								<li dir="auto">Child abuse</li>
								<li dir="auto">Animal cruelty</li>
							</ul>
							<h4 data-heading="Frequently 'Veiled' Topics:" dir="auto">Frequently 'Veiled' Topics:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">Racism</li>
								<li dir="auto">Discrimination against minorities</li>
								<li dir="auto">Sexuality in general</li>
								<li dir="auto">Torture</li>
								<li dir="auto">Spiders</li>
								<li dir="auto">Snakes</li>
								<li dir="auto">Clowns</li>
								<li dir="auto">Dentists</li>
								<li dir="auto">Serious illnesses</li>
								<li dir="auto">Sexism</li>
								<li dir="auto">Suicide</li>
							</ul>
							<p dir="auto">This should be a starting point for the conversation, not definitive check list. I will give my list at the end.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Themes and Boundaries" dir="auto">Themes and Boundaries</h2>
							<p dir="auto">There are many topics that I do not care to hear about in real life; harm to marginalized groups, women, children, violence, religion, etc. However, in dramatic stories these topic frequently arise. This is true even for darker topics within the context of villains or evil NPCs. My hope is that players will act as the force to oppose these actions. But these are my preferences.</p>
							<p dir="auto">For backstories, especially in horror games, it’s okay to explore darker themes. Just be mindful of other players’ boundaries and the tone we’ve established. (Another reason not to come to the table with preconceived ideas about your characters.)</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Conflict Resolution" dir="auto">Conflict Resolution</h2>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>In-Character Conflict</strong>: Conflict between characters can add to the story, but it should serve the narrative and not disrupt the group dynamic. Always consider how your character’s actions impact the party. Don't be <em>that</em> person. If it is 'what your character would do' then maybe that character doesn't fit the party.</li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Out-of-Character Conflict</strong>: I prefer not to get involved in out-of-character disputes unless I’m directly involved. I’m a storyteller, not a mediator. If conflicts arise, try to resolve them respectfully among yourselves. </li>
							</ul>
							<h2 data-heading="Role-Playing" dir="auto">Role-Playing</h2>
							<p dir="auto">In my games, immersive role-playing is encouraged. Try to avoid saying “my character does X” or “my character says Y.” Instead, speak and act as your character. You don’t need to be a professional actor, but embracing the role will enhance the experience for everyone.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Player Respect" dir="auto">Player Respect</h2>
							<p dir="auto">While our characters may clash and NPCs may engage in morally questionable behavior, it’s essential that players treat each other with respect. Regardless of the actions within the game, I expect players to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Respect each other’s beliefs and views</strong> without pushing them onto others. </li>
								<li dir="auto"><strong>Create a welcoming environment</strong> where no player feels insulted, ignored, bullied, or made uncomfortable.</li>
							</ul>
							<p dir="auto">Disagreements about in-game decisions are natural, but they should never escalate into personal attacks. If an issue arises that makes you uncomfortable, please let me or another player know so we can address it.</p>
							<p dir="auto">We’re here to create a fun and immersive experience together, and that starts with mutual respect at the table.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Communication" dir="auto">Communication</h2>
							<p dir="auto">If you need to reach me outside of the game, feel free to contact me via <strong>Discord</strong> or <strong>email</strong>. I’m always open to hearing feedback, answering questions, or discussing any concerns you might have.</p>
							<h2 data-heading="Warnings About My Style" dir="auto">Warnings About My Style</h2>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">In real life, most people do not view themselves as 'bad'... even when they are demonstrably acting that way. People are great at rationalizing their actions. Many of my villains do that too! So morally gray NPCs are common. </li>
								<li dir="auto">Improv is big part of my style. I love seeing the story we make together. That does mean I tend to forget things like minor NPCs names that were made up on the spot. Player notes help players and storytellers alike!</li>
								<li dir="auto">I like to start each session with a player recapping the last session. This allows me to see things from the other side. If I didn't explain something well, or a clue was missed, or some action is taking on more importance in the players' minds then was intended, this helps me see that.</li>
								<li dir="auto">I like long running stories where one event bleeds into the next. So it is a challenge for me to do things episodically. I can do it, it just goes against my nature.</li>
								<li dir="auto">I have told stories for over 40 years. That means I have 40 years of bad habits, not that I know more than someone else. I am still surprised most times I sit down to play.</li>
								<li dir="auto">I am here to have fun. I hope you are too. We work together to make sure every reaches this goal.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2 data-heading="My List of Lines and Veils" dir="auto">My List of Lines and Veils</h2>
							<p dir="auto">I am very flexible on my list. Within the context of a good story I can move a line to a veil and ignore a veil altogether. But as a starting point here is my list:</p>
							<h3 data-heading="Lines" dir="auto">Lines</h3>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">
									Graphic roleplaying of taboo topics such a torture, abuse of minors, and sexuality between PCs
									<ul>
										<li dir="auto">I am very sex positive but I don't wish to be engaged in PCs erotica. If it comes up in a story, state the <em>minimum</em> and move on. Violence happens in a game, state the <em>minimum</em> and move on. Full on role-playing out such acts is a line for me.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li dir="auto">
									Audio/Visual of people in pain or abused, especially children
									<ul>
										<li dir="auto">In a story I can handle dark topics but I do not care to see or hear such things. This includes in audio props or visuals produced as props.  </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 data-heading="Veils" dir="auto">Veils</h3>
							<ul>
								<li dir="auto">Gratuitous violence without a story reason</li>
								<li dir="auto">Abuse of minors or the non-consenting</li>
								<li dir="auto">
									Manipulation for the 'fun of it'
									<ul>
										<li dir="auto">Bad guys do bad things, got it. Sometimes the details are needed for a clue but let's keep even that to a minimum.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

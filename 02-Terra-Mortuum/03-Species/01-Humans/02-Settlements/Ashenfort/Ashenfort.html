class="article-title">Ashenfort</h1></div></div><article class="popover-hint"><h1><strong>Ashenfort: The Gray City of Eternal Struggle</strong></h1>
<p>Ashenfort, often referred to as the <strong>Gray City</strong>, is a resilient stronghold perched precariously between the realms of life and death, human and undead. Located near the southwestern border of the human-controlled lands, Ashenfort sits on the ruins of an ancient kingdom, which in turn was built on the remnants of the Old Civilization. For thousands of years, this location has been a point of contention between humans and Gravlings, each vying for control over its unique combination of mundane and magical resources.</p>
<h2><strong>A City of Shifting Zones</strong></h2>
<p>Ashenfort lies near what many believe is an <strong>anti-node</strong>, a volatile and unpredictable area that experiences frequent <strong>Zonal Shifts</strong>. These shifts alter the city's alignment between the human and Gravling Zones, leading to long cycles of occupation by both sides. The current Zone configuration, established 27 years ago, allows for human habitation on the surface, while many sections of the undercity remain in the Gravling Zone, making them perilous and filled with undead horrors. The close proximity of the Zone border causes the city to exist in a constant state of wariness, as Gravlings still wage a low-level conflict from beneath, using the undead and other monstrosities to harass the human settlers.</p>
<h2><strong>The City of Walls and Towers</strong></h2>
<p>When approaching Ashenfort, two defining features immediately dominate the landscape: its massive, ancient <strong>walls</strong> and the towering spires that punctuate the skyline. The walls, constructed during the Old Civilization era, are a testament to the cityâs history of constant warfare. These fortifications have been rebuilt and reinforced countless times, bearing the scars of human and Gravling battles alike. The <strong>towers</strong>, on the other hand, reflect Ashenfortâs need to expand upward rather than outward due to the unstable ground surrounding the city. Ashenfortâs limited buildable land has forced the inhabitants to construct multi-story buildings and elevated walkways, giving the city its distinct vertical architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>A Legacy of Conflict and Reclamation</strong></h2>
<p>Ashenfortâs history is a tapestry of destruction and renewal. Over the last 500 years, the city has shifted between human and Gravling control six times. Each change has left its mark on the cityâs architecture, culture, and people. Every faction that claims the city reworks and subsumes the work of its predecessors, creating a patchwork of old and new structures, both above and below ground. Reclamation efforts after the most recent shift have been ongoing for 22 years, and while the humans have restored much of the surface, the undercity remains a dangerous labyrinth of Gravling-built crypts, tunnels, and dungeons filled with undead and dark magic.</p>
<h2><strong>A Nexus of Resources and Trade</strong></h2>
<p>Despite its perilous location, Ashenfort thrives due to its access to rare and valuable resources, both magical and mundane. It sits at the crossroads of vital trade routes, making it a hub for merchants, adventurers, and scholars seeking to profit from its unique position. The cityâs underground rivers provide a steady supply of fresh water, supporting a small but vital fishing industry, while its stone quarries supply durable materials for fortifications and trade.</p>
<p>However, what truly sets Ashenfort apart are the magical resources found deep beneath the city. The rare <strong>Ashen Stone</strong>, a powerful ore that amplifies magic, draws potion brewers and traders from across the region, while the more sinister <strong>Moribund Crystals</strong>ânecromantic artifacts coveted by those seeking power over life and deathâfuel a lucrative black market despite the efforts of the Church of the Golden Dawn to suppress their circulation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Struggle Beneath</strong></h2>
<p>Though humans have reclaimed the surface, the <strong>undercity</strong> remains a contested battleground. Many sections of the old Gravling strongholds still exist beneath the surface, where the Zone shift did not fully penetrate. These areas are home to undead creatures, cursed relics, and the remnants of Gravling architecture. Expeditions into the undercity, particularly into the <strong>Bone Vaults</strong> and <strong>Gravling Bastion</strong>, are dangerous but necessary, as they hold valuable resources like <strong>Ashen Stone</strong> and the relics of past civilizations. The Church of the Golden Dawn leads the charge in cleansing these areas, though success has been limited, and adventurers are frequently hired to assist in the fight against the undead.</p>
<h2><strong>A City Ruled with Caution</strong></h2>
<p>At the helm of Ashenfort is <strong>Lord Mayor Randal</strong>, a cautious and calculating ruler with a deep interest in old civilization technology. While he governs the cityâs political and military affairs, he also conducts personal research into ancient artifacts, hoping to unlock their secrets for the benefit of his people. Randal's leadership is marked by a pragmatic approach to Ashenfortâs defenses, but his aloofness from the general populace has led to a complex system for gaining his audience, with most citizens dealing directly with the <strong>Council of Magistrates</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>The Church of the Golden Dawn</strong></h2>
<p>Religiously, Ashenfort is dominated by the <strong>Church of the Golden Dawn</strong>, a zealous faction of the <strong>Church of the Eternal Wanderer</strong> committed to fighting necromancy and preserving the sanctity of life and death. The church plays a pivotal role in the city's defense, cleansing the crypts and purging the undead that still haunt the undercity. Led by <strong>High Priestess Thalara Flameheart</strong>, the Golden Dawn inspires fierce devotion among the populace, rallying them to defend their city against the ever-present threat of the undead.</p>
<h2><strong>Government: Lord Mayor Randal</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Protocol for Gaining an Audience with Lord Mayor Randal</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Petition Submission</strong>
<ul>
<li>Citizens or visitors must first submit a formal written petition to the <strong>Council of Magistrates</strong>, a small group of trusted bureaucrats who manage the day-to-day affairs of Ashenfort. Petitions must include:
<ul>
<li>The petitionerâs name, title, and business in Ashenfort.</li>
<li>A brief description of the issue or request.</li>
<li>Any references from prominent individuals (e.g., guildmasters, clergy, or nobility).</li>
<li>Proof of the petitionerâs standing in the city, such as business ownership, guild membership, or affiliation with an organization like the Church of the Golden Dawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Council of Magistrates reviews these petitions once per week and determines whether they warrant further consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Council Screening</strong>
<ul>
<li>If the Council deems the petition worthy, the petitioner must attend a <strong>screening interview</strong> with one or more magistrates. During this interview, they will be questioned in detail about their request or problem.</li>
<li>If the petitioner cannot adequately justify why the matter should reach Lord Mayor Randalâs attention, the request is denied at this stage.</li>
<li>Those found to be wasting the Councilâs time can face fines or even temporary imprisonment, depending on the severity of their infraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Referral to the Steward</strong>
<ul>
<li>If the Council agrees that the matter is urgent or significant enough, they will pass the petition to <strong>Steward Mycroft</strong>, Lord Randalâs personal assistant and chief gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Steward Mycroft is a shrewd, no-nonsense man who has been with Randal for over a decade. He meticulously manages the mayorâs schedule and serves as the final filter for any audience requests.</li>
<li>Mycroft conducts a second interview, during which the petitioner must convince him that their issue cannot be resolved through normal channels (such as the city guard, the council, or the guilds). If the petitioner passes this stage, they will be granted an audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Audience Preparation</strong>
<ul>
<li>The audience itself takes place within the <strong>Hall of Concord</strong>, a formal chamber within Ashen Keep. Before entering, petitioners must:
<ul>
<li>Dress in appropriate attire (provided by the keepâs stewards if necessary).</li>
<li>Refrain from bringing any weapons, artifacts, or dangerous items into the audience chamber.</li>
<li>Swear an oath of honesty and respect for the mayorâs authority, overseen by a priest of the Golden Dawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Audience</strong>
<ul>
<li>Audiences with Lord Randal are strictly timed and monitored. Petitioners are typically allowed 10-15 minutes to present their case.</li>
<li>Randal himself speaks little during these meetings, preferring to listen and assess. He asks pointed questions and often makes decisions quickly, delegating matters to the Council or other officials if needed.</li>
<li>If Randal deems the issue worthy of his personal attention, he may take the matter under advisement and schedule a follow-up. Otherwise, the petitioner is dismissed, and the case is closed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Special Circumstances</strong>
<ul>
<li>There are certain circumstances where protocol can be bypassed, but these are rare. Individuals with direct ties to the Church of the Golden Dawn, powerful guildmasters, or high-ranking nobility may have the ability to request an audience directly through Steward Mycroft, but even they must have a compelling reason.</li>
<li>Emergencies that threaten Ashenfortâs security or Randalâs personal research may also result in expedited audiences, though these are almost always handled through the cityâs military and arcane defenses before reaching Randal himself.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>Key Church Members</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: High Priestess of the Church of the Golden Dawn in Ashenfort.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Thalara Flameheart carries the fierce passion of the cityâs history in her blood.

</ul>
<h5><strong>Thalara Flameheart's Background</strong></h5>
<p>The <strong>Flameheart</strong> familyâs history is intertwined with the rise and fall of Ashenfort. Over 500 years ago, the city was part of a powerful kingdom that collapsed due to internal strife, religious rebellion, and the shifting of the Zone. According to local legend, the Flamehearts were instrumental in leading a religious uprising against the monarchy, rallying the people in the name of faith and freedom. This rebellion, though violent, ultimately led to the dissolution of the kingdom and established the foundation for the current City-State of Ashenfort.</p>
<p>Since that time, the Flamehearts have maintained a deep connection to the city, not only spiritually but physically as well. Family tradition dictates that every member is interred in a crypt beneath the secret ruins of the old throne room. This crypt is sacred to the Flamehearts and is hidden away from the Gravlings during Zone shifts. The family has safeguarded this location for centuries, ensuring it remains untouched by undead forces.</p>

<p>Thalara, like her ancestors, fiercely protects the secrets of the Flamehearts. She knows the exact location of the family crypts and has ensured that this information remains within the family. Her ability to shield the crypt from the Gravlings during Zone shifts is a well-guarded secret, passed down through generations. This knowledge gives her family a unique position of influence in Ashenfort, one that many of the cityâs most powerful families respect.</p>
<h5><strong>Family Ties in Ashenfort</strong></h5>
<p>Due to the Flamehearts' deep roots in Ashenfort, most of the cityâs prominent families are related to them in some way. This web of connections gives Thalara both allies and distant relatives throughout the city, further solidifying her influence. Even those who are not direct descendants often claim some connection to the Flamehearts, as having a relation to the family is considered a mark of status and respect.</p>
<p>Thalara wields this network carefully, using her familial ties to maintain the church's authority and ensure that the city's religious and political structure remains in balance. Though many look up to her as a beacon of spiritual guidance, she is also a cunning leader, deeply aware of the legacy she must uphold.</p>

*"You had to go and learn for yourself, didn't you?"*
A look of anger, panic and fear each fought to control his mother's face as she moved the hair from his ashen brow. Dobbin had seen each of these emotions overtake her before. His mother was nothing if not... excitable. OK, she was a lot excitable. But there was always some subtle tell; some sly hint that she wasn't truly angry or panicked or afraid. He always thought that she just liked making a scene. The over-the-top warnings, her cries of feigned fear when he got in a fight and her sobs over the dangers her 'stupid baby boy' faced in his trades was just her excuse to be heard.
This was different. There was no cocked smile or quick wink now. There was only raw emotion.
Time passed but he could not tell how long. As the young man's hands began to stiffen, and his vision clouded, he could just make out the tears that flowed down her face as she stood from where she was kneeling by his bed. She left his room quickly. As he tried to call out to her, tried to say he was sorry, only a wet grumble came from his throat. A mass fell from his mouth and his face began to twitch uncontrollably.
 He was so cold. Cold and starving.
--- 
A lifetime later she returned. The raw emotion replaced with cold, sterile, determination. In one hand she held the family's felling axe. In the other, the Beams of God that usually stayed above the hearth.
As she knelt once more by his bed, she whispered.
*"I am so sorry baby."*
She choked back the tears and continued.
*"How many tales did we tell you? How many warnings to stay out of the Northern Fields? We didn’t do enough."*
The battle with her emotions was taking a turn as her words began to take on the wet, fluid sound of uncontrollable loss.
It was then that Dobbin realized he had been holding his breath. As he tried to fill his lungs with air he found no heady relief; no soothing of the burning in his chest.
His eyes went wide as his heart began to slow.
His muscles started to twitch and break the bones of his toes.
His ears felt like they have been stuffed full of dandelion seeds.
She never let go of the hand of his hand. Even as the flesh pulled away from his nail bed and his convulsions tore through him with enough strength to break her little finger she held fast. She had failed him before. The least she could do now was to be with him while he was still … her baby.
And then it stopped.
Like a candle snuffed out, the boy... the human … died. She freed her damaged hand and stood.
In her good hand she reached down and cradled the Beams of God and tried to remember the ‘Prayer of the Good Death’. Slowly the words came to mind.
*"O Spirit, As Dobbin journeys through the Sheltered Route's serene domain, Let him find rest from his mortal travels."*
As she started, so too did the transformation. The human had left and the gravling was arriving much sooner than expected. He had spent too long in their domain. The days she had hoped the family had to mourn was quickly turning into minutes of terror.
*"Gu-Gu-Guarded him from the clutches of a sleepless second life, so his soul may bask in the dreams of everlasting night."*
Never letting the sign of her family's faith slip from her good hand, she took up the axe in her broken one...just in case her prayer wasn't enough.
*"In the Sheltered Route's Haven, let my little boy find reprieve,"*
As the broken shell of her only son started to rise, she thought of her daughters. The pain in her hand as she gripped the handle for the blow made the last line tear from her mouth like storm.
*"Where eternal rest he shall achieve."*

# Future English Language Summary
The Old Civilization spoke a form of English. That English was not like 21<sup>st</sup> century English; it was a streamlined and simplified form. The intent of this language is that the form of English spoken by the Old Civilization is as different to 21<sup>st</sup> century English as 21<sup>st</sup> century English is to Middle English. 
## 1. Phonetic Simplification
Every word in future English is spelled exactly as it is pronounced. The alphabet has been reduced further, and the pronunciation of certain letters has been standardized. **Verbs never end in "l" or "d"** as those letters are reserved for indicating tense.
## 2. Reduced Alphabet
The final alphabet consists of the following **consonants** and **vowels**:
### **Consonants**:
- **B** = /b/ as in *bat*
- **C** = /tʃ/ as in *chair* (represents the "ch" sound)
- **D** = /d/ as in *dog* (reserved for past tense when used at the end of verbs)
- **F** = /v/ as in *van* (always voiced)
- **G** = /g/ as in *gold* (always hard)
- **H** = /h/ as in *hat*
- **K** = /k/ as in *cat*
- **L** = /l/ as in *lamp* (reserved for future tense when used at the end of verbs)
- **M** = /m/ as in *man*
- **N** = /n/ as in *note*
- **P** = /p/ as in *pen*
- **R** = /r/ as in *run*
- **S** = /z/ as in *zeal* (always voiced)
- **T** = /t/ as in *top*
- **W** = /w/ as in *wind*
### **Vowels**:
- **A** = /æ/ as in *cat* (always short)
- **E** = /ɛ/ as in *bed* (always short)
- **I** = /ɪ/ as in *bit*
- **O** = /ɔ/ as in *dog* (always short)
- **U** = /ʌ/ as in *cup*
## 3. Pronunciation and Sound Merges
- **F** is always voiced, representing the **/v/** sound.
- **G** is always hard, representing the **/g/** sound.
- **S** is always voiced, representing the **/z/** sound.
- **A**, **E**, and **O** are always short, so **AE**, **EE**, and **OO** are eliminated.
## 4. Verb Rules
Verbs cannot end in **"l"** or **"d"**, as these letters are reserved for marking tense:
- **Present Tense**: The verb remains in its base form.
- **Past Tense**: Add **"-d"** to the verb to indicate past action. Example: "I walked" → **I wokd**.
- **Future Tense**: Add **"-l"** to the verb to indicate future action. Example: "I will walk" → **I wokl**.
### Verb Examples:
- **walk** → **wok** (base form)
- **wokd** → past tense
- **wokl** → future tense
## 5. Articles
- **A**: Used for both "a" and "an". The form **"an"** is dropped.
## 6. Pronouns:
- **I** = I
- **Yu** = You
- **It** = He/She/It (no gender distinctions)
- **Wi** = We
- **Dei** = They
## 7. Plurals
Plurals are formed by adding **-s** to the noun:
- Example: "child" → **chils**, "man" → **mans**
---
## 8. Adverbs in Future English
To keep the adverb formation simple and consistent, I propose that adverbs be created by adding **"-e"** to the base form of the adjective. This rule applies universally, simplifying adverbs and making them distinct from verbs, nouns, and adjectives.
### Adverb Formation Rules:
- **Adjectives** are transformed into **adverbs** by adding **"-e"** at the end.
#### Examples:
| **Adjective**  | **Adverb**  | **Meaning**          |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| fast           | faste        | quickly              |
| slow           | sloue        | slowly               |
| strong         | stronge      | strongly             |
| soft           | softe        | softly               |
| quiet          | quite        | quietly              |
| bright         | brite        | brightly             |
| quick          | quicke       | quickly              |
The **"-e"** suffix avoids overlap with verbs, keeping adverbs easily distinguishable. 
### Example Sentences:
1. **She ran fast.**
   - **Future English**: It ran faste.
2. **He spoke softly.**
   - **Future English**: It spok softe.
3. **They will walk quickly.**
   - **Future English**: Dei wokl quicke.

# **Terra Mortuum Player Guide**
## **Introduction to Terra Mortuum**
- Overview of the world: post-technological collapse, mutated Zones, and a society struggling to survive.
- Themes: Gritty survival, mutation, and the fragmented remnants of an advanced civilization.
- Player objective: Characters navigate a dangerous world where survival is threatened by the environment and the lingering consequences of the past.
## **The World of Zones**
- Zones: Unique regions where environmental mutations affect the inhabitants. Each species can only survive in its home Zone or in neighboring Zones for a limited time.
- Key Zones: Human (Sheltered Route), Halfling (Northern Fields), Gravling, Goblin, Dwarven Zone.
- Shifting Boundaries: Zone borders shift unpredictably, changing the landscape and making survival even more perilous.
## **Peoples of Terra Mortuum**
- **Humans**: Mutated into Gravlings upon death without religious intervention. They are the only species able to access True Magic (artifacts).
- **Halflings**: Their religion controls property and defines halfling identity through land leases. Halflings are tied to their Zone for sustenance.
- **Other Species**:
    - **Goblins**: Known for their savage ways, their mutations affect their hearing outside their Zone.
    - **Gravlings**: The undead that decay rapidly outside their Zone.
    - **Dwarves**: Solidify and become stone outside their Zone.
## **Religion in Terra Mortuum**
- **The Divine**: All species follow the same god, but each has a different name, iconography, and religious tenets.
- **Humans**: The Church of the Eternal Wanderer, divided into five branches:
    - **Order of the Silver Sun**: Traditionalists, strict adherence to rituals.
    - **Golden Dawn**: Emphasize personal spiritual experiences and emotional devotion.
    - **Azure Tide**: Focus on material prosperity as a sign of divine favor.
    - **Crimson Flame**: Advocate for social justice and reform.
    - **Emerald Path**: Promote harmony with nature.
- **Halfling Religion**: A singular church system that owns all property, with land leases defining social status.
- **Other Species**: Goblins, Gravlings, and Dwarves each have unique variations of faith centered around survival in their mutated Zones.
- **The Cult of the Risen**: A controversial human cult that reveres the undead as a sign of divine will. Some cultists even seek to birth True Gravlings.
## **Magic in Terra Mortuum**
- **Potion-Based Magic**: Available to all species. Classic spells are translated into alchemical brews with specific methods of application (consumed, splashed, inhaled).
    - **Potion Mechanics**:
        - Brewing potions takes skill and the right ingredients.
        - Potions are delivered through drinking, throwing, or inhaling.
        - Critical successes double effects; failures can cause mishaps.
- **True Magic**: Found in the form of artifacts from a forgotten civilization, usable only by humans.
    - **Artifacts**: Rare and misunderstood, these ancient technologies take years of research to activate and are often discarded due to their connection to the past.
## **Survival in Terra Mortuum: Leaving Your Zone**
In Terra Mortuum, each species has adapted to their specific Zone’s unique environmental conditions, but leaving their home Zone can be deadly. The mutations that allow them to thrive in one area make survival in other Zones difficult—and sometimes impossible. Below are the specific dangers each species faces when they leave their Zone, along with the time limits before death becomes inevitable.
### **Humans (Sheltered Route)**
- **Effect**: Humans who leave their Zone lose the ability to heal naturally. Their bodies stop regenerating, even with magical assistance, and they approach death at an accelerated rate.
- **Time Limit**: A human can survive in a neighboring Zone for 100 days, two Zones removed for 10 days, and three Zones removed for just 1 day. Past that, death is inevitable.
- **Symptoms**: As time progresses, the human experiences fatigue, open wounds won't close, and their health deteriorates rapidly. Medical treatments are ineffective outside the Sheltered Route.
### **Halflings (Northern Fields)**
- **Effect**: Halflings lose the ability to gain sustenance from any food not grown in their home Zone. No matter how much they eat in other Zones, they will starve.
- **Time Limit**: Like humans, they can survive 100 days in a neighboring Zone, 10 days two Zones removed, and only 1 day three Zones removed before starvation becomes fatal.
- **Symptoms**: Halflings experience gradual weakness, loss of muscle mass, and intense hunger pangs, even if they continue eating. The body simply cannot absorb nutrients from foreign food sources.
### **Goblins**
- **Effect**: Goblins develop severe problems with their ears when they leave their Zone, eventually going deaf. As pressure builds in their ears, the condition worsens until it causes a fatal rupture.
- **Time Limit**: Goblins can survive 100 days in a neighboring Zone, 10 days two Zones removed, and 1 day three Zones removed.
- **Symptoms**: Goblins first lose their hearing, followed by intense pain in the head as pressure builds. Nosebleeds, dizziness, and eventual brain hemorrhaging lead to death.
### **Gravlings**
- **Effect**: Gravlings are sustained by an undead force tied to their Zone. When they leave it, this force weakens, causing their bodies to decay at an accelerated rate.
- **Time Limit**: Gravlings can survive for 100 days in a neighboring Zone, 10 days two Zones removed, and only 1 day three Zones removed.
- **Symptoms**: Gravlings visibly rot faster outside their Zone. Limbs may fall off, and their bodies deteriorate into dust if they remain outside their Zone for too long.
### **Dwarves**
- **Effect**: Dwarves experience a unique form of petrification when they leave their Zone. Their bodies slowly turn to stone, rendering them immobile and eventually leading to death.
- **Time Limit**: Dwarves have the same survival window as other species—100 days in a neighboring Zone, 10 days two Zones removed, and only 1 day three Zones removed.
- **Symptoms**: Their limbs stiffen progressively, making movement more difficult. Eventually, their entire body solidifies, turning into stone and leaving them permanently immobilized.
---
### **Zone Boundaries & Survival Strategy**
- **Zone Shifting**: The boundaries of Zones are not stable, and the shifting of a Zone can suddenly put characters at risk if they find themselves outside their home region.
- **Survival Gear**: Certain potions or artifacts might temporarily stave off the negative effects of being outside one’s Zone, but no known magic can fully negate the deathly consequences of prolonged exposure.

*It is said that, lost in the fog of time, we were all one.* 
*One nation, one religion, one species.* 
*But that was so long ago. And, if we are honest, do we care? Have any of you shed even a single tear for this 'old civilization'? I know I haven't. Devils know if any one ever has.*
*And why should we care? These are forefathers who have abandon their children! These parents of means and wealth have left their children no inheritance. No inheritance save division, isolation and a broken land. They deserve no tears, no nostalgia, no thoughts. Let them lie forgotten and cold. It is more than they deserve.*
- Drunken thoughts overheard in the High Tide public house of Emberport.   
# The World
Every game world has something that makes it special. Some lands claim that the gods walk among mortals. In other worlds, dragons rule or time is broken or one of a thousand different tropes.
Tera Mortuum is no different. Its foundations are build on the bedrock of fantasy tropes too. The history of Terra Mortuum is one of a human civilization that rose to the heights of technological advancements only to collapse through their own folly. 
This story has been told before. It will be told again. 
So what makes Terra Mortuum different?
As a whole, the peoples of Terra Mortuum do not care about their ancestors. They know that a fallen people brought the world ruin by their greed. These ancient people consumed all that could be consumed and left behind a toxic corpse of a planet. 
Today's people will never know the same levels of grandeur. All because of the avarice of the past. 
So the people of Terra Mortuum try not to think of the past. And when the specter of that ancient civilization ***is*** dug up, the only emotions it is met with are distain and bitterness. It is because of the 'old civilization' that they will never know ease or unity. 
On the whole, most feel that the best punishment for the ancient's hubris is to ... forget them.
# Zones
One of the fallout from the 'old civilization' is an instability in the climates of the world. However, this instability manifests itself not by erratic weather pattern. The instability is in habitability. Whatever disaster the ancients brought upon themselves causes 'Zones' across the face of the planet where the descendants slowly adapted to thrive in. But this adaptability came at a cost. A person leaving their 'Zone' may survive a few months without some support system in the neighboring 'Zone'. But the further away a person travels from their 'Zone' (as measured by Zones crossed), the shorter their lifespan can be expected to be.  
| Zones Removed From Home Zone | Average Survival Time |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                            | 100 days              |
| 2                            | 10 days               |
| 3                            | 1 day                 |
| 4                            | 1 hour                |
| 5                            | 6 minutes             |
| 6                            | 10 seconds            |
| 7                            | 1 second              |
Furthermore, while each Zone's inhabitants share a common ancestor, the years of exposure to the Zone's effects has cause new species to form. Humans, halflings, goblins all exist in Terra Mortuum but they usually interact near the borders of two or more Zones. Furthermore, the adaptions brought on by the Zones makes interbreeding between peoples impossible.
If the Zones were stable, then interspecies conflict would be rare. But like a seasonal jet stream, the edges of the zones can move. In some areas, the borders move only a few miles. In others, the displacement can be hundreds of miles. The displacement seems to be greater the further away from established cities a region is. This displacement might last only a season or a year. Or it might last decades or more. The pattern seems to unpredictable. A border might be stable for centuries, moving only a few feet at most, only move a hundred miles for a decades at random. 
Given that the rich farmlands, deep harbors and great mineral deposits seem to result from these border shifts, it is not surprising that border settlements are not uncommon. The risk is worth the reward for some. 
## People
This adaption should not be thought of in a scientific way. It is the *magic* of the ancients that have changed each people in strange and unique ways. 
### Halflings
Halflings share their southern border with Humans, Gravlings and Goblins to the Southwest. While in their Zone, which is translated to the Human tongue as the 'Northern Fields', halflings feast on a vegetarian diet. This has given them a reputation as great farmers. But the same thing that makes them masters at agriculture, also ties them to the land. The foodstuffs of other Zones do not sustain the small people. Without a regular diet of fresh food from their homeland the begin to waste away; all while eating as much as they like. After only a week on a non-halfling diet, halflings begin to suffer. Their strength begins to go, their minds fog and they grow obese. After as little as three months on a foreign diet, halflings die. Their bodies obese from there uncontrollable attempt to sustain themselves on toxic food.
Halflings who have had to suffer a foreign diet will, even after returning to their native food, always bare the marks of the ordeal; weaken bodies, confused minds, and a soft belly.
The further from their home foodstuffs, the more toxic the food, water and even air is to these people. When forced out of their homelands, Halflings will eat meat; it is not pleasant for them (digestively, spiritually, etc.) but desperate times call for desperate measures.
### Humans
The peoples of the 'Sheltered Route' are the closed to the people of the 'old civilization'. In recovered images, the humans look almost identical there forefathers. But they are not saved from changes brought on by living in a Zone. 
Their hindrance is undeath. 
Even within their Zone, humans that die, but do not have their spirits released from the world, will return as an unnatural monster; the undead. Most of these creatures are mindless monsters but outside of their homeland, some humans become something darker. 
The undeath they face is one as ghoul, vampire or even a lich. The further from home they die, the faster and more evil a monster they become. 
Even humans who return home from extended travels abroad run this risk as well. It can take months or years for their constitution to recover (if ever). They heal slower and run the risk of turning faster than the Prayer of the Good Death can be recited. 
### Goblins
In the "Howling Hills" of the lands that the Goblins call home, there is a lower, constant drumming. The sound seems to come from the ground itself. To the short people, it is a comforting, religious sound. It influences their language, their ceremonies, even their mood. When the ground drums slowly, goblins are at peace. When the cadence grows, so to do their passions and drive. The land and the people are joined in a joyous union. 
But as a Goblin moves further away from their homeland, the absence of the rhythm drives them mad. Their ears bleed as they grow; desperate to hear a note of the land's beat. Their mood becomes dark and desperate in an attempt to reach balance with a land that does not embrace them. 
In a few months without the music of home, a Goblin becomes a suicidal monster. If the land will not give them comfort then they will silence the only beating they can still hear. The one that mocks their desperation. The beating of the living heart. They will stop all the 'evil' music foreigners force on their ears before their own heart stops to save the last of their sanity.
Goblins that spent too much time from home, return to find their ears have grown tin and their heart lags behind the lands tempo.
In recent years, Goblins have been raid Halfling lands in a savage attacks. This has led many Halflings to take refuge among the humans. While Goblins are rare in Human lands (they are two Zones from home), they have been known to conduct raids in the Sheltered Route. Diplomacy has broken down between the peoples. While there are several hypothesizes about why the war has started, no one is positive as to the Goblins reasons or goals.

# **Potion-Based Magic Mechanics**
![[brewing.png]]
The magic of potions is the magic of the common people. Unlike 'True' magic, potion magic is available to all species. Recipes must be learned or researched. The appropriate equipment must be available. 
The intent is to provide a system similar to magic in Shadowdark, Old-School Essentials or other OSR system that works for this world. My goal was to make the system flavorful but still keep with the spirit of the systems.
- Brewing is a downtime activity
- Use can occur during action scenes
- Success/Failure is not a binary - partial success during use is possible.
## **Brewing Potions**
- **Potion Brewing Skill**: Characters with the "Potion Mastery" talent (or equivalent) can brew potions. To brew a potion, make a brewing check by rolling 1d20 + your Intelligence (or Alchemy) modifier.
- **Brewing Difficulty**: The DC to successfully brew a potion is 10 + the potion’s tier. Failure results in wasted ingredients and a potential mishap (similar to spellcasting mishaps).
- **Long Brew Times**: Brewing a potion typically takes several hours to several days, depending on the potion’s tier and complexity. This is a downtime activity.
- **Ingredients**: More powerful potions require rarer, and more quest-worthy, ingredients.
## **Using Potions**
- **Delivery Methods**: Potions must be consumed, splashed, inhaled, or otherwise applied to deliver their effects. When using a potion, the player rolls an "Application Check," which determines whether the potion's effects succeed.
    - **Check Type**: Roll 1d20 + Dexterity (for thrown potions like splash vials) or opposed Constitution (for consumed or inhaled potions).
    - **Difficulty**: The DC is 10 + the potion’s tier. On success, the potion works as intended.
    - **Failure**: The potion fails to activate, potentially wasting the dose **or** having reduced effects.
## **Critical Success & Failure**
- **Critical Success (Natural 20)**: Double one of the potion’s numerical effects, such as increased damage, longer duration, or enhanced healing.
- **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: The potion backfires or has an unintended consequence. Roll on a mishap table specific to potion use (e.g., causing an explosion, poisonous vapors, or incorrect effect).
## **Potion Tiers**
- Potions, like spells, are divided into tiers (1–5). Higher-tier potions require rarer ingredients, more complex brewing processes, and longer preparation times.
    - **Example Tier 1 Potions**: Healing Draft (equivalent to Cure Wounds), Fire Flask (equivalent to Burning Hands when splashed), Potion of Invisibility (mimics Invisibility).
    - **Example Tier 2 Potions**: Acid Flask (equivalent to Acid Arrow), Levitation Brew (equivalent to Levitate), Paralysis Toxin (equivalent to Hold Person).
## **Duration & Range**
- **Potion Duration**: Varies depending on the type. A healing draft may be instant, while a strength-enhancing potion may last several rounds. For splash potions like a Fire Flask, the effect is instantaneous.
- **Potion Range**: "Self" range means the potion must be consumed or applied by the user, while "Near" or "Far" potions (such as a splash vial) can be thrown up to a specific distance.
## **Ingredient Gathering**
- Potions require specific ingredients, which players must gather during their adventures or purchase from specialists.
    - **Rarity & Cost**: Higher-tier potions require rarer, more expensive ingredients.
    - **Foraging Check**: Players can search for ingredients in the wild by making a Nature or Survival check (DC depends on environment and ingredient rarity).
## **Potion Mishaps Table**
(When rolling a natural 1 or failing critically on brewing/application)
The following are for inspiration. 
- **Volatile Reaction**: The potion explodes in your hands, dealing 1d6 damage to you and anyone within close range.
- **Spoiled Brew**: The potion spoils, releasing a rancid odor that attracts nearby creatures within a near range.
- **Wrong Effect**: The potion takes on the properties of a completely different brew (roll on a random potion table or GM’s choice).
- **Delayed Activation**: The potion doesn't work immediately; its effects trigger 1d6 rounds later, potentially at an inopportune time.
- **Toxic Fumes**: The potion releases poisonous vapors, causing all creatures within close range to make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 poison damage.
- **Reduced Potency**: The potion works, but at half its normal strength (e.g., healing half as much or dealing half damage).
- **Backfire**: Instead of affecting the target, the potion affects the user (or the wrong target, if thrown).
- **Sticky Residue**: The potion leaves a sticky film on everything it touches, halving the target’s movement speed for 1d4 rounds.
- **Corrupted Brew**: The potion’s magic backfires, causing the user to suffer 1d4 temporary Constitution damage for 1d4 hours.
- **Overload**: The potion’s effects are amplified, but in an uncontrolled way. Damage, healing, or other effects are doubled, but the user suffers 1d4 rounds of debilitating fatigue afterward.
- **Hallucinations**: Instead of the intended effect, the potion causes vivid hallucinations lasting 1d6 rounds, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe.
- **Reverse Effect**: The potion has the opposite effect of what was intended (e.g., a healing potion causes damage, a fire potion creates ice).
- **Unstable Mutation**: The user grows an extra limb, eye, or other minor mutation for 1d4 hours, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity-based checks.
- **Spilled or Shattered**: The potion container slips from your hands, shattering on the ground and becoming unusable.
- **Mind Numb**: The potion causes the user’s mind to temporarily go blank, imposing disadvantage on Intelligence-based checks for 1d4 hours.
- **Foul Taste**: The potion is so foul-tasting that the user vomits immediately, losing their next action.
- **Combustion**: Upon application, the potion causes the target (or user, if consumed) to ignite in flames, taking 1d6 fire damage each round until extinguished.
- **Magical Echo**: The potion’s effect repeats uncontrollably, causing the same effect to happen again in 1d4 rounds (potentially with disastrous results).
- **Inversion**: The potion causes all spells or magic effects on the user to invert for 1d4 rounds (e.g., healing becomes harm, protection becomes vulnerability).
- **Random Effect**: The potion has an entirely random effect.
## **Tier 1 Potions** (Basic and common potions)
It is assumed that the ingredients to prepare these are minor in cost and/or require a DC 11 (10 + 1) to forage.
- **Healing Draft**: Restores 1d6 HP when consumed.

- **Potion of Minor Healing**: Heals 1d4 HP when consumed (less potent than the Healing Draft).

- **Potion of Blazing Aura**: Surrounds the drinker in a fiery aura, dealing 1d6 fire damage to any creature within close range for 1d4 rounds.

# **New Edge Village**
Nestled on the edge of the dense Red Fur Forest and overlooking the tranquil Trout Stream River, New Edge Village was once a picturesque settlement, now fallen on hard times. The village is a patchwork of thatched cottages and sturdy stone buildings. Despite its recent struggles, New Edge remains a symbol of resilience and warmth, where the community stands strong against adversity.
Located at the border of the **[[Northern Fields]]**, a halfling Zone, New Edge has become a refuge for halfling refugees fleeing the invasion of their homeland by goblins. These refugees cannot survive long in human lands, as their bodies require food from the Halfling Zone to sustain them. Nevertheless, the village has opened its doors to those in need, and halfling scouts often lead parties back into their home Zone in search of critical supplies.
New Edge is a key frontier village, where humans and halflings coexist, albeit under difficult circumstances. The village is close enough to the shifting Zone boundaries that it must constantly adapt to the dangers of nearby Zone changes. Life in New Edge is one of constant vigilance, but it is also marked by camaraderie, as the villagers face their challenges together. It is the northern most human settlement on the main contented. 
## **Key Locations**:
- **Greenthorn Apothecary**: A small apothecary shop run by Adelaide Greenthorn, the village herbalist. Here, villagers can purchase medicinal herbs, potions, and remedies to treat ailments and injuries. Adelaide also offers herbal consultations and advice on natural healing practices. She is assisted by her adopted apprentice, Millrunner, a young and eager halfling orphan..
- **Ironwood Blacksmith**: A once-thriving blacksmith shop operated by Cedric Ironwood and his stepdaughter Anna.
- **Stonebridge Mill House**: A mill located along the river, providing milling services to the community. The mill in New Edge Village is a sturdy stone building situated along the banks of the river, its waterwheel churning steadily in the current. The sound of rushing water fills the air as the wheel turns, powering the intricate machinery within. A thatched roof shelters the entrance, and a wooden sign bearing the image of a millstone hangs above the door. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of freshly ground barley, and sacks of grain line the walls, waiting to be milled into fine powder.  The cost to grind a bushel of product at the mill is typically three silver pennies. This fee covers the labor and upkeep required to operate the mill as well as the 1 silver penny tax that goes to the coffers in Emberport. The owner of the mill is Roderick Stonebridge, a hardworking man with a deep love for his craft. Roderick inherited the mill from his father and has spent his life mastering the art of milling. He takes great pride in the quality of his work and is known for his reliability and fair prices. Roderick is always willing to lend a helping hand to his fellow villagers, whether it's repairing a broken wagon wheel or offering advice on baking. He has a wife, Elda, and three young sons; the triplets.
- **Thornhill Manor**: The grand home of Eldric Thornhill, the village elder, and community leader.
- **Inn-on-River**: Services/Unique Feature: A cozy inn and tavern where travelers can find food, drink, and lodging.

- **Fairweather Farmstead**: A flourishing farm owned by Lucas Fairweather.
- **Willowbrook Cottage**: The home of Agatha Willowbrook, the eccentric village seer.
- **River’s Edge**: A riverside fishery owned by a group of skilled fishermen who specialize in catching trout and other freshwater fish from Troutstream River. Here, villagers can purchase fresh fish, smoked fish, and seafood delicacies, as well as fishing equipment and supplies.
- **Graystone Masonry**: A stone masonry workshop operated by skilled craftsmen who specialize in building and repairing structures using locally sourced materials. Greystone Masonry offers services such as stone carving, wall construction, and chimney repair, ensuring that the village's buildings remain sturdy and resilient. This is the second masonry in the village's history. The previous one was abandoned, sealed and forgotten about by the village generations ago.
- **Fairweather Farmstead**: Fairweather Farmstead is a picturesque homestead nestled in the rolling countryside just outside of New Edge Village. Surrounded by fields of barley and verdant pastures, the farmstead exudes an air of tranquility and rustic charm. The main farmhouse, a sturdy wooden structure with a weathered facade, sits at the heart of the property, overlooking the surrounding landscape with a sense of quiet dignity. The farmstead is a hive of activity, bustling with the sights and sounds of agricultural life. In the fields, farmers toil under the warm sun, tending to rows of crops with care and precision. Cattle graze lazily in the pastures, their contented lowing mingling with the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves in the breeze. On the hill, olive vines flourish. A well-worn dirt path winds its way through the farmstead, connecting the various outbuildings and structures scattered across the property. A spacious barn stands at one end of the path, its doors wide open to welcome the harvest. Inside, the scent of hay and livestock fills the air, mingling with the sounds of animals and the clatter of farm implements. Nearby, a quaint farmhouse garden blooms with colorful flowers and aromatic herbs, tended to with loving care by the farmstead's residents. A small orchard of fruit trees provides a bountiful harvest in season, while a patchwork of vegetable plots yields fresh produce for the farmhouse kitchen. Despite its humble origins, Fairweather Farmstead is a testament to the resilience and determination of its inhabitants. Under the stewardship of Lucas Fairweather the farmstead has flourished, becoming a thriving agricultural enterprise that serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration for the surrounding community.
- **Alliance of Villages**: The Alliance of Villages is a coalition of neighboring settlements that have come together to provide support and assistance to each other in times of need. Member villages share resources, coordinate defense efforts, and collaborate on trade agreements to promote mutual prosperity.  Despite their collective strength, the Alliance of Villages faces challenges in maintaining unity and cooperation among its members. Each village has its own priorities and interests, leading to occasional disagreements and disputes over resource allocation and trade policy. Additionally, external threats such as goblin raids and natural disasters can strain the alliance's resources and test its resolve.  The local representative of the Alliance is Melody Riversong. Melody is a respected elder in New Edge Village, known for her compassion and commitment to justice and equality. She serves as the representative of the Alliance of Villages, overseeing aid provided to the halfling refugees. Melody cares deeply about the halfling refugees, having witnessed their suffering first hand during a goblin ambush. She feels a personal connection to their plight and is determined to offer them assistance and compassion. She believes fervently in the principles of the Alliance of Villages, which espouses cooperation and solidarity among neighboring settlements. She sees aiding the halfling refugees as upholding these values and ensuring the well-being of all members of the community. Melody also recognizes the strategic importance of maintaining good relations with the halfling community. She understands that cooperation between humans and halflings is essential for the prosperity and security of both groups, and she is committed to fostering positive relations through acts of kindness and generosity. Given the recent economic down turn in the village, support for her cause is waning.

This ruins where once a church of the Crimson Flame. At one time, this was the main religion in the area. New Edge Village was founded as a religious village by members of the Crimson Flame.  Rumors abound about how and why the Crimson Flame's church was destroyed. Some villagers claim that it was destroyed during a violent uprising led by followers of the Order of the Silver Sun, who sought to eradicate all traces of the rival religion from the village. Others believe that the church was struck by lightning during a fierce storm, interpreted by some as a sign of divine retribution for the Crimson Flame's perceived heresy. However, the truth behind the church's destruction remains shrouded in mystery, fueling speculation and superstition among the villagers.

She has since come to take great pride in her skill in arrow construction.

# **Ashenfort: The Gray City of Eternal Struggle**
Ashenfort, often referred to as the **Gray City**, is a resilient stronghold perched precariously between the realms of life and death, human and undead. Located near the southwestern border of the human-controlled lands, Ashenfort sits on the ruins of an ancient kingdom, which in turn was built on the remnants of the Old Civilization. For thousands of years, this location has been a point of contention between humans and Gravlings, each vying for control over its unique combination of mundane and magical resources.
## **A City of Shifting Zones**
Ashenfort lies near what many believe is an **anti-node**, a volatile and unpredictable area that experiences frequent **Zonal Shifts**. These shifts alter the city's alignment between the human and Gravling Zones, leading to long cycles of occupation by both sides. The current Zone configuration, established 27 years ago, allows for human habitation on the surface, while many sections of the undercity remain in the Gravling Zone, making them perilous and filled with undead horrors. The close proximity of the Zone border causes the city to exist in a constant state of wariness, as Gravlings still wage a low-level conflict from beneath, using the undead and other monstrosities to harass the human settlers.
## **The City of Walls and Towers**
When approaching Ashenfort, two defining features immediately dominate the landscape: its massive, ancient **walls** and the towering spires that punctuate the skyline. The walls, constructed during the Old Civilization era, are a testament to the city’s history of constant warfare. These fortifications have been rebuilt and reinforced countless times, bearing the scars of human and Gravling battles alike. The **towers**, on the other hand, reflect Ashenfort’s need to expand upward rather than outward due to the unstable ground surrounding the city. Ashenfort’s limited buildable land has forced the inhabitants to construct multi-story buildings and elevated walkways, giving the city its distinct vertical architecture.
## **A Legacy of Conflict and Reclamation**
Ashenfort’s history is a tapestry of destruction and renewal. Over the last 500 years, the city has shifted between human and Gravling control six times. Each change has left its mark on the city’s architecture, culture, and people. Every faction that claims the city reworks and subsumes the work of its predecessors, creating a patchwork of old and new structures, both above and below ground. Reclamation efforts after the most recent shift have been ongoing for 22 years, and while the humans have restored much of the surface, the undercity remains a dangerous labyrinth of Gravling-built crypts, tunnels, and dungeons filled with undead and dark magic.
## **A Nexus of Resources and Trade**
Despite its perilous location, Ashenfort thrives due to its access to rare and valuable resources, both magical and mundane. It sits at the crossroads of vital trade routes, making it a hub for merchants, adventurers, and scholars seeking to profit from its unique position. The city’s underground rivers provide a steady supply of fresh water, supporting a small but vital fishing industry, while its stone quarries supply durable materials for fortifications and trade.
However, what truly sets Ashenfort apart are the magical resources found deep beneath the city. The rare **Ashen Stone**, a powerful ore that amplifies magic, draws potion brewers and traders from across the region, while the more sinister **Moribund Crystals**—necromantic artifacts coveted by those seeking power over life and death—fuel a lucrative black market despite the efforts of the Church of the Golden Dawn to suppress their circulation.
## **The Struggle Beneath**
Though humans have reclaimed the surface, the **undercity** remains a contested battleground. Many sections of the old Gravling strongholds still exist beneath the surface, where the Zone shift did not fully penetrate. These areas are home to undead creatures, cursed relics, and the remnants of Gravling architecture. Expeditions into the undercity, particularly into the **Bone Vaults** and **Gravling Bastion**, are dangerous but necessary, as they hold valuable resources like **Ashen Stone** and the relics of past civilizations. The Church of the Golden Dawn leads the charge in cleansing these areas, though success has been limited, and adventurers are frequently hired to assist in the fight against the undead.
## **A City Ruled with Caution**
At the helm of Ashenfort is **Lord Mayor Randal**, a cautious and calculating ruler with a deep interest in old civilization technology. While he governs the city’s political and military affairs, he also conducts personal research into ancient artifacts, hoping to unlock their secrets for the benefit of his people. Randal's leadership is marked by a pragmatic approach to Ashenfort’s defenses, but his aloofness from the general populace has led to a complex system for gaining his audience, with most citizens dealing directly with the **Council of Magistrates**.
## **The Church of the Golden Dawn**
Religiously, Ashenfort is dominated by the **Church of the Golden Dawn**, a zealous faction of the **Church of the Eternal Wanderer** committed to fighting necromancy and preserving the sanctity of life and death. The church plays a pivotal role in the city's defense, cleansing the crypts and purging the undead that still haunt the undercity. Led by **High Priestess Thalara Flameheart**, the Golden Dawn inspires fierce devotion among the populace, rallying them to defend their city against the ever-present threat of the undead.
## **Government: Lord Mayor Randal**
### **Protocol for Gaining an Audience with Lord Mayor Randal**
1. **Petition Submission**
    - Citizens or visitors must first submit a formal written petition to the **Council of Magistrates**, a small group of trusted bureaucrats who manage the day-to-day affairs of Ashenfort. Petitions must include:
        - The petitioner’s name, title, and business in Ashenfort.
        - A brief description of the issue or request.
        - Any references from prominent individuals (e.g., guildmasters, clergy, or nobility).
        - Proof of the petitioner’s standing in the city, such as business ownership, guild membership, or affiliation with an organization like the Church of the Golden Dawn.
    - The Council of Magistrates reviews these petitions once per week and determines whether they warrant further consideration.
2. **Council Screening**
    - If the Council deems the petition worthy, the petitioner must attend a **screening interview** with one or more magistrates. During this interview, they will be questioned in detail about their request or problem.
    - If the petitioner cannot adequately justify why the matter should reach Lord Mayor Randal’s attention, the request is denied at this stage.
    - Those found to be wasting the Council’s time can face fines or even temporary imprisonment, depending on the severity of their infraction.
3. **Referral to the Steward**
    - If the Council agrees that the matter is urgent or significant enough, they will pass the petition to **Steward Mycroft**, Lord Randal’s personal assistant and chief gatekeeper.
    - Steward Mycroft is a shrewd, no-nonsense man who has been with Randal for over a decade. He meticulously manages the mayor’s schedule and serves as the final filter for any audience requests.
    - Mycroft conducts a second interview, during which the petitioner must convince him that their issue cannot be resolved through normal channels (such as the city guard, the council, or the guilds). If the petitioner passes this stage, they will be granted an audience.
4. **Audience Preparation**
    - The audience itself takes place within the **Hall of Concord**, a formal chamber within Ashen Keep. Before entering, petitioners must:
        - Dress in appropriate attire (provided by the keep’s stewards if necessary).
        - Refrain from bringing any weapons, artifacts, or dangerous items into the audience chamber.
        - Swear an oath of honesty and respect for the mayor’s authority, overseen by a priest of the Golden Dawn.
5. **The Audience**
    - Audiences with Lord Randal are strictly timed and monitored. Petitioners are typically allowed 10-15 minutes to present their case.
    - Randal himself speaks little during these meetings, preferring to listen and assess. He asks pointed questions and often makes decisions quickly, delegating matters to the Council or other officials if needed.
    - If Randal deems the issue worthy of his personal attention, he may take the matter under advisement and schedule a follow-up. Otherwise, the petitioner is dismissed, and the case is closed.
6. **Special Circumstances**
    - There are certain circumstances where protocol can be bypassed, but these are rare. Individuals with direct ties to the Church of the Golden Dawn, powerful guildmasters, or high-ranking nobility may have the ability to request an audience directly through Steward Mycroft, but even they must have a compelling reason.
    - Emergencies that threaten Ashenfort’s security or Randal’s personal research may also result in expedited audiences, though these are almost always handled through the city’s military and arcane defenses before reaching Randal himself.

### Key Church Members
#### **Thalara Flameheart**
- **Role**: High Priestess of the Church of the Golden Dawn in Ashenfort.
- **Description**: Thalara Flameheart carries the fierce passion of the city’s history in her blood. Her name evokes the fiery resilience of Ashenfort, a city that has been repeatedly reclaimed from the Gravlings. Thalara’s leadership is marked by her intense emotional connection to the divine and her people, and she is known for her ability to inspire fervor and devotion. She embodies the flame of renewal and destruction, a symbolic figure for Ashenfort’s rebirth from the ashes of its own history. Her sermons are often filled with fiery imagery, invoking the city’s historical battles and the eternal struggle between life and death.
##### **Thalara Flameheart's Background**
The **Flameheart** family’s history is intertwined with the rise and fall of Ashenfort. Over 500 years ago, the city was part of a powerful kingdom that collapsed due to internal strife, religious rebellion, and the shifting of the Zone. According to local legend, the Flamehearts were instrumental in leading a religious uprising against the monarchy, rallying the people in the name of faith and freedom. This rebellion, though violent, ultimately led to the dissolution of the kingdom and established the foundation for the current City-State of Ashenfort.
Since that time, the Flamehearts have maintained a deep connection to the city, not only spiritually but physically as well. Family tradition dictates that every member is interred in a crypt beneath the secret ruins of the old throne room. This crypt is sacred to the Flamehearts and is hidden away from the Gravlings during Zone shifts. The family has safeguarded this location for centuries, ensuring it remains untouched by undead forces.
##### **Thalara's Role in the Present**
As the current High Priestess of the **Church of the Golden Dawn**, Thalara Flameheart is not only a spiritual leader but a symbol of Ashenfort’s resilience and rebirth. She draws upon the legacy of her ancestors, invoking their rebellion and passion in her sermons. Her leadership is marked by intense devotion, and she is known for her fiery, inspiring presence in the city. The people of Ashenfort look to her for guidance, especially during the city's long efforts to rebuild after the last Gravling occupation.
Thalara, like her ancestors, fiercely protects the secrets of the Flamehearts. She knows the exact location of the family crypts and has ensured that this information remains within the family. Her ability to shield the crypt from the Gravlings during Zone shifts is a well-guarded secret, passed down through generations. This knowledge gives her family a unique position of influence in Ashenfort, one that many of the city’s most powerful families respect.
##### **Family Ties in Ashenfort**
Due to the Flamehearts' deep roots in Ashenfort, most of the city’s prominent families are related to them in some way. This web of connections gives Thalara both allies and distant relatives throughout the city, further solidifying her influence. Even those who are not direct descendants often claim some connection to the Flamehearts, as having a relation to the family is considered a mark of status and respect.
Thalara wields this network carefully, using her familial ties to maintain the church's authority and ensure that the city's religious and political structure remains in balance. Though many look up to her as a beacon of spiritual guidance, she is also a cunning leader, deeply aware of the legacy she must uphold.
#### **Father Aurelius Dorne**
- **Role**: Senior Priest of the Golden Dawn.
- **Description**: A stern, authoritative figure, Father Aurelius ensures that the rituals and traditions of the church are meticulously followed.

The Church of the Eternal Wanderer is the name given to the followers of [[The Eternal Wanderer]]. This religion is, effectively, a [[Humans|human]] only faith. While there is a single 'Church', the reality is that there are five 'churches' or branches of the faith. 
## Major Churchs
### The Order of the Silver Sun
 They believe in strict adherence to tradition and ritual, viewing themselves as the rightful guardians of the true faith. They look down upon other religions, considering them to be heretical or deviant in their practices. 
- They dislike the followers of the Golden Dawn for what they perceive as excessive zeal and fervor, seeing them as fanatics who prioritize emotional experiences over proper reverence for God.
- They openly clash with the followers of the Crimson Flame due to theological differences, particularly regarding interpretations of scripture and the role of clergy in society. The Order of the Silver Sun sees the Crimson Flame as overly liberal and prone to dangerous innovations.
### The Golden Dawn
 They emphasize personal spiritual experiences and emotional devotion to the god, which puts them at odds with the more formal and structured approach of the Order of the Silver Sun. 
- The Golden Dawn sees the Silver Sun as cold and impersonal in their worship.
- They view the followers of the Azure Tide with suspicion, considering them to be overly focused on material wealth and worldly power. The Golden Dawn believes that true faith should be humble and selfless, contrasting with the ostentatious displays of the Azure Tide.
- They have little respect for the followers of the Crimson Flame, whom they see as lacking discipline and moral fortitude. The Golden Dawn considers the Crimson Flame to be too lax in their adherence to religious doctrine and prone to moral corruption.
### The Azure Tide
 They prioritize material prosperity and worldly success as signs of divine favor, leading them to look down upon other religions that do not share their emphasis on wealth and power. The Azure Tide sees themselves as the chosen elite of the god, destined for greatness. 
- They view the followers of the Order of the Silver Sun with disdain, considering them to be stuck in the past and resistant to change. The Azure Tide sees the Silver Sun as outdated and irrelevant in the modern world, clinging to outdated traditions that hold back progress.
- They clash with the followers of the Golden Dawn due to ideological differences, particularly regarding the role of wealth and luxury in religious practice. The Azure Tide sees the Golden Dawn as naïve and idealistic, prioritizing spiritual matters over practical concerns.
### The Crimson Flame
 They advocate for social justice and equality, which puts them at odds with the hierarchical structure and elitist attitudes of the Azure Tide. The Crimson Flame sees the Azure Tide as selfish and greedy, exploiting the less fortunate for their own gain. 
- They dislike the followers of the Order of the Silver Sun for their conservative values and rigid adherence to tradition. The Crimson Flame believes in progress and innovation, viewing the Silver Sun as obstructive to social change and reform.
- They clash with the followers of the Golden Dawn due to philosophical differences, particularly regarding the role of emotion and passion in religious expression. The Crimson Flame sees the Golden Dawn as overly emotional and prone to irrationality, lacking the intellectual rigor of their own faith.
### The Emerald Path
 They advocate for harmony with nature and the natural world. 
- The Emerald Path sees the Azure Tide as reckless and destructive, prioritizing profit over environmental sustainability.
- They view the followers of the Order of the Silver Sun with skepticism, considering them to be disconnected from the earth and its rhythms. The Emerald Path sees the Silver Sun as too focused on abstract concepts and rituals, neglecting the tangible blessings of nature.
- They clash with the followers of the Golden Dawn due to their materialistic values and focus on personal wealth. The Emerald Path sees the Golden Dawn as selfish and shortsighted, prioritizing their own spiritual enlightenment over the well-being of the natural world.
## Cults
There is one notable cult that names [[The Eternal Wanderer]] as their divine patron. The Cult Of The Risen. 
### The Cult Of The Risen
This cult subscribes to the believe that necromancy is evil but does not believe that the undead are evil. They view the existence of the undead as a sign that the Divine wishes them to continue to live beyond the boundries of death. While these members do feel suicide is an evil they have no issue with death via combat, accident or other non-self induced wounds; these are paths to everlasting life. These cultist make for dangerous foes. Even within this small group there is a division. There is a group of fanatic women who believe that having the child of a [[Gravlings|gravling]] is a virtue. They will attempt to birth a a single '_True'_ gravling, raise the child until early adolescence, find a way to become a 'Second Life' gravling and then continue their parenthood for years or decades. This mother/child combination become a powerful and frightening pair.

The God of  [[Humans]] is known as the The Eternal Wanderer. While iconography varies by religion, all churches agree that the Eternal Wanderer is an older human, holding aloft an oil lantern, torch or similar light. They are often shown guiding human souls along the path of death.
### Divine Symbols & Sigils
[[Beams of God]]
### Tenets of Faith
Followers of the Eternal Wanderer hold life as sacred. Furthermore, they hold that necromancy, the undead and the disturbing of graves are sources of ultimate evil. This is most likely due to the mutations that [[Humans]] face in the [[Sheltered Route]].

This has pushed the halflings into a painful choice: stay and fight (which some have), seek sanctuary among the [[Gravlings]] (which has had very dark consequences) and seek asylum with the [[Humans]] (the most common solution).

In the "Howling Hills" of the lands that the Goblins call home, there is a lower, constant drumming. The sound seems to come from the ground itself. To the short people, it is a comforting, religious sound. It influences their language, their ceremonies, even their mood. When the ground drums slowly, goblins are at peace. When the cadence grows, so to do their passions and drive. The land and the people are joined in a joyous union. 
But as a Goblin moves further away from their homeland, the absence of the rhythm drives them mad. Their ears bleed as they grow; desperate to hear a note of the land's beat. Their mood becomes dark and desperate in an attempt to reach balance with a land that does not embrace them. 
In a few months without the music of home, a Goblin becomes a suicidal monster. If the land will not give them comfort then they will silence the only beating they can still hear. The one that mocks their desperation. The beating of the living heart. They will stop all the 'evil' music foreigners force on their ears before their own heart stops to save the last of their sanity.
Goblins that spent too much time from home, return to find their ears have grown tin and their heart lags behind the lands tempo.
In recent years, Goblins have been raid Halfling lands in a savage attacks. This has led many Halflings to take refuge among the humans. While Goblins are rare in Human lands (they are two Zones from home), they have been known to conduct raids in the Sheltered Route. Diplomacy has broken down between the peoples. While there are several hypothesizes about why the war has started, no one is positive as to the Goblins reasons or goals.

Gravlings, or the second lived, are in every meaningful way, the undead. While it is possible for a Gravling to father a child, Gravlings are usually the result of the corruption of the lands known as the [[Northern Fields]] or through the unconsecrated death of [[Humans]] in the [[Sheltered Route]] . 
### Subspecies
Gravlings come in two varieties: 'True' gravlings and 'Second Life' gravlings. Gravlings females are barren and how they are 'born' is the basis for the difference. 
#### True
While some times used as an insult, and sometimes as a title of resepect, 'True', 'One Life' or 'Unpolluted' gravlings are gravlings born from a human mother. These individuals usually have a more 'life' like appearance and have mental capabilities similar to humans. This can be the result of a 'grave birth' (where the mother dies, is given the [[Prayer of the Good Death]] but the child is passed from the mother shortly thereafter) or the mating of a gravling father and a human mother.  In rare cases, a human that spends too much time in the gravling's zone can be changed such that everyone of their future offspring will be a 'True' gravling (on top of contracting 'Grave Sickness' and the accelerated turning after they pass).  
### Second Life
Second life, or the 'Reborn' are gravlings that formed when a [[Humans|human]] dies in the [[Sheltered Route]] without receiving the [[Prayer of the Good Death]]. These gravlings are usually, but not always, returned to the world as little more than a mindless zombie. A few, rare, individuals retain some spark of their former selves. These individuals, whether retaining their mental state or not, always take on the classic 'undead' visage.

Little is known of this species. What little is known comes from the survivors who wandered into neighboring [[Zones]].  Rumors, 'common knowledge', and assumptions:
- Orcs stand over 8' tall
- The species is cannibalistic
- Orcs cannot consume plant material
- Once outside of their zone, Orcs will turn into swine withing 24 hours
- The species does not have the ability to speak. This seriously limits efforts at diplomacy.

## The World
Terra Mortuum is a low fantasy world where everyone is human... or at least they were. In ages past, it is understood that humans ruled the planet. But then something happened. 
- Some say it was religious and this is why the Divine only answers the prayers of humans just before they die.
- Some say it was magical and this is why humans have been deprived of arcane power.
- And some say it was technological and this is why humans have access to magic.
 Regardless, few care about this history. What is important is the here and now; history and God can wait. 
## Archetypes
## Races
It is _strongly_ recommended that players generate [[Humans]]. The world is designed around other races being ... other. However, if one must go against this recommendation, there are two races that _could_ be allowed: [[Gravlings]] and the [[Halflings]]. Due to the nature of how magic works in Terra Mortuum, and the fantasy nature of the world, not every option is available during character generation. Furthermore, there exists new options. This options are **marked in bold** in the tables below. Options are taken from the _Savage Worlds Adventure Edition Core Rulebook_ and the _Savage Worlds Adventure Edition Fantasy Companion_. When the option is listed in both book, the Fantasy Companion takes priority. This page takes priority over both of those books.

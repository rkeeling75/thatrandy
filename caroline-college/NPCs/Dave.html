<p><img src="../../caroline-college/Assests/Dave.png" alt/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Unknown (only referred to as &quot;Dave&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: Pirate radio host of the show <em>Metal At Midnight</em></li>
<li><strong>Broadcast Frequency</strong>: Hijacks <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/WCTU" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/WCTU">WCTU</a></li>
<li><strong>Show Time</strong>: The show is very sporadic. When it does air, it starts exactly at midnight and runs until it gets cut off. Metal At Midnight has never ran past 6:14 am.</li>
<li><strong>Personality</strong>: Dave is a paranoid conspiracy theorist, blending metal music with rants about government surveillance, cults, and supernatural forces. His ramblings often contain pieces of truth, but they are wrapped in layers of wild theories, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. He is energetic, often sidetracked, and uses stoner slang like &quot;bro,&quot; &quot;man,&quot; and &quot;dude.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Beliefs</strong>: Convinced that shadowy forces (cults, the government, secret societies) are tracking him. He sees himself as a voice for the oppressed and the counterculture, using metal music as a form of rebellion. Dave regularly mocks the satanic panic of the 1980s, claiming the real evil is something far worse, lurking beneath the surface in Watashuka.</li>
<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: No one knows what Dave looks like. Despite efforts to trace his broadcast, neither the authorities nor the college have located his signal. Some suspect he could be a former student or professor, or even an outsider hiding in the townâs outskirts.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Daveâs rants, though erratic, often contain cryptic hints about the supernatural events in Watashuka. His listenersâespecially metalheadsâmay pick up on these clues, though they have to decode his chaotic monologues to find useful information. He may also have insight into the time loop or Project Caroline, though he doesnât fully understand what heâs uncovered.</li>
<li><strong>Mannerisms</strong>: Known for laughing maniacally during his broadcasts and jumping between topics, often blending real-world events with conspiracy theories. He distrusts everyone, especially those in positions of authority.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Role in the Game</strong>:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Source of Information</strong>: Daveâs broadcasts can help players uncover clues about the supernatural events in Watashuka, but his unreliable narration means players must sift through his rants for useful information.</li>
<li><strong>Connection to the Occult</strong>: Although he mocks the satanic panic, Dave inadvertently exposes the townâs real occult activity. He sees himself as a rebel fighting against shadowy forces but doesnât fully realize the depth of the dangers he uncovers.</li>
<li><strong>Rallying Point</strong>: Dave serves as a symbol of rebellion for the townâs metalheads and outcasts. His pirate broadcasts encourage youth counterculture and inspire them to push back against the townâs more conservative forces.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Rumors About Dave</strong>:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ghost Broadcaster</strong>: Some say Dave died in a car accident years ago and now broadcasts from beyond the grave using old radio frequencies.</li>
<li><strong>An Old Professor</strong>: A popular theory is that Dave is a disgruntled former professor from Caroline College, who left after being involved in occult studies.</li>
<li><strong>In League with the Cults</strong>: Some claim Dave is a cultist, using his broadcasts to send coded messages to his followers.</li>
<li><strong>A Rebel Student</strong>: Others believe Dave is a current student using the collegeâs equipment to host his show without the administrationâs knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Government Spy</strong>: A few conspiracy theorists think Dave is actually an undercover agent for Project Caroline, using his show to monitor the town.</li>
<li><strong>Lives in the Tower</strong>: Thereâs a rumor that Dave broadcasts from Qubit Tower, hiding in its old, unused rooms.</li>
<li><strong>The Forgotten Son</strong>: Another rumor suggests Dave is the illegitimate child of a prominent family, using his show to exact revenge.</li>
<li><strong>Amish Defector</strong>: Some speculate Dave fled the Amish community and now rebels against the strict traditions he grew up with.</li>
<li><strong>A Dark Ritual Survivor</strong>: A few believe Dave was the sole survivor of a failed occult ritual in the 1970s and now uses his show to expose Watashukaâs supernatural underbelly.</li>
<li><strong>A Figment of Imagination</strong>: There are those who insist that Dave doesnât exist, and &quot;Metal at Midnight&quot; is simply a hallucination broadcast by the ley lines themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Examples of Dave Lines:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Intro:</strong> &quot;Hey, hey, hey, midnight marauders! This is <em>Metal At Midnight</em>, comin' at ya live from...well, you donât need to know where, bro. Letâs just say Iâm somewhere those government goons canât find me, but I know theyâre listening. âCause THEY always are, man. But hey, screw âem! Letâs get into some Sabbath to start your night rightâthis one goes out to all the truth-seekers, dude.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Supernatural Events:</strong> &quot;So, check this out, man...thereâs been some freaky stuff goinâ down in this town for a long time. Like, way longer than anyone talks about. Iâm talkinâ weird symbols, secret meetings at night, and I swear, I saw someone in a black robe hanging out near that creepy old slaughterhouse. They donât want you to know, but I do. The truthâs out there, man!&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heavy Metal and the Occult:</strong> &quot;You know what gets me, bro? These squares think metalheads are worshiping the devil or whatever. But no way, man! Weâre the ones fighting back against the REAL dark stuff. We got the music, we got the guts, and weâre not bowing down to whatever weird cult crap is really goin' on. Up the irons, bro! And now, letâs hear some Maiden!&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paranoia:</strong> &quot;And before you ask, NO, Iâm not givinâ out my location, man! 'Cause THEY are out there, waiting. Yeah, thatâs rightâI see you, you shadowy government spooks, tryinâ to shut me down. But you canât! Not as long as the metal keeps playinâ, man.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On the Strange Calls Michelina Gets:</strong> &quot;Oh, and shoutout to that WCTU chick, Michelinaâsheâs got someone messinâ with her, and I KNOW who it is, but I ainât sayinâ yet. Just know, sheâs in deep, and whoeverâs callinâ her? Not from this world, bro. You gotta be careful with that stuff.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ideas for Future Shows:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>&quot;Spooky Science? Or Something More Sinister?&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> The playersâ investigation into the biology lab might result in rumors spreading about strange happenings during the lab exercises. Perhaps students gossip about freaky occurrences, unusual sounds, or even the feeling that the classroom was &quot;haunted&quot; during the dissection.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;So, listen up, man...</strong> I got word that some of you little lab rats had a <em>real</em> spooky time in bio class last week. You think that dissection was just frogs and microscopes? Think again, bro. Thereâs more going on in those biology labs than your teachers are letting on. Strange symbols, weird <em>feelings</em> in the airâ¦ Hell, I bet itâs all part of some crazy ritual, man. Yeah, theyâre slicing more than frogs in there, broâkeep your eyes peeled for anything that looks <em>too</em> weird. And if you see those symbols? RUN.&quot;<br/>

<h3><strong>&quot;Whereâd the Valley Girl Go?&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Rumors about <strong>Amy Mannâs disappearance</strong> spread across campus. Students may have seen her acting suspiciously before vanishing or noticed undercover agents pretending to be campus police poking around her dorm.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Yeah, so check this outâ¦</strong> that valley girl whoâs been making the rounds at Caroline College? Word on the street is sheâs <em>gone</em>âlike, <em>poof</em>, vanished. Cops showed up, but you know as well as I do that theyâre not telling us everything. What was she into? Who was watching her? Could it beâ¦ <em>THEY</em>? Keep your head on a swivel, kids. Itâs always the ones you least expect.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Iron Maidenâs âStranger in a Strange Landâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;Thereâs Something Rotten in Bio Lab!&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> As players continue to investigate, strange phenomena tied to the failed or ongoing ritual might be reported, such as flickering lights, eerie sensations, or even rumors of supernatural activity. Students might whisper about feeling cold spots or hearing whispers in the bio lab after the playersâ first encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Yo, listen up, bro!</strong> Word from the inside says things have been getting real weird in that biology lab. Lights flickering, shadows moving where they shouldnât be, and a couple of students claiming they heard whispers when no one else was there. Iâm telling you, man, something went down thereâsomething big. Theyâre trying to cover it up, but the truth always gets out, man. So if youâve got a class in that lab? Watch your back.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Metallicaâs âCreeping Deathâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;Class Dissected, Reality Warped&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Students gossiping about a failed lab experiment or the freaky occurrences during the ritualâs climax could reach Daveâs ears. His conspiracy-obsessed mind would exaggerate the events, weaving them into a narrative about secret government experiments or occult rituals.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;So get this, man...</strong> word is that some kinda <em>ritual</em> went wrong in the biology lab last week. Yeah, you heard me rightâa ritual, bro. And no, it ainât your regular science experiment. Iâm talking <em>symbols</em>, <em>weird lights</em>, and things <em>levitating</em>, dude. You know what that means, right? Theyâre messing with forces they donât understand. You feel that chill in the air? Thatâs not just bad AC, broâthatâs reality tearing at the seams.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Black Sabbathâs âInto the Voidâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;The Vanishing Frog and the Not-So-Innocent Sub&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Rumors spread about the strange behavior of the <strong>substitute teacher</strong> leading the biology class. Maybe students noticed their odd jewelry (occult symbols) or overheard cryptic phrases related to the ritual. Dave could latch onto this, suspecting the sub is tied to the cult or the government.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Okay, so like, check this out...</strong> that sub in the bio lab? Theyâre not who they say they are. Iâve heard rumors that theyâre sporting some <em>real</em> freaky jewelryâoccult stuff, man. And theyâre always muttering weird things under their breath. Yeah, I knowâit sounds nuts, but Iâm telling you, THEY are hiding something. Theyâre in on the ritual stuff, bro. And the way they were running that lab class? Totally sus. Watch out for themâtheyâre more than just a teacher.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Judas Priestâs âBreaking the Lawâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;Amyâs Ghost? Or Something Worse?&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> After Amy Mannâs disappearance, rumors of sightings or eerie phenomena around campusâpossibly tied to her undercover work or the supernaturalâmight start to circulate. People might claim to have seen Amyâs figure at night, but her behavior seems off.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Yo, this is a wild one...</strong> some folks are saying theyâve <em>seen</em> that valley girl walking around at night, but sheâs not <em>acting</em> like herself, man. Like, spooky stuffâshadows flickering, people hearing her voice when sheâs not around. Is it a ghost? A doppelgÃ¤nger? Or maybe sheâs got caught up in something way worse. Either way, bro, keep your eyes peeled. If you see her, donât get too close.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Ozzy Osbourneâs âBark at the Moonâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;The Bio Lab Conspiracy&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Students might talk about the weird energy or lingering effects after the ritualâs failure (or success). The idea that the biology lab is &quot;haunted&quot; or cursed could spread through campus, and Dave would latch onto this, weaving it into his conspiracy theories.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;So, thereâs this buzz goin' around...</strong> the bio labâs been off ever since that thing went down last week. People are saying the roomâs <em>haunted</em> or cursed. Like, bro, Iâm telling you, itâs not just your usual science mishap. Theyâve got <em>rituals</em> going on in there, and whatever they were summoning? Itâs left a mark. The walls remember, man. The lights flicker for a reason. That room ainât safe anymore.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Iron Maidenâs âFear of the Darkâ)</em></li>

<hr/>
<h3><strong>&quot;Cover-Up at Caroline!&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> If the players uncovered some evidence of a connection between the <strong>biology lab</strong> and the cult (or even Project Caroline), Dave might get wind of the university or local authorities trying to cover it up. His broadcast would reflect his growing paranoia about hidden forces at work.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;You think the schoolâs lookinâ out for you? Wrong, bro.</strong> Word on the street is theyâre <em>covering up</em> whatever went down in that lab. And the local cops? Yeah, theyâre in on it too. The truth is, this goes way deeper than some missing valley girl or a botched dissection. Weâre talkinâ full-blown <em>conspiracy</em> to hide whatever the hell they were trying to summon. Keep digging, and maybe youâll find the real truth. Just donât let THEM find you first.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Megadethâs âHangar 18â)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Nighttime &quot;Dumpster Operation&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Someone may witness or overhear players sneaking into <strong>Sister Sarahâs Medical Center</strong> or spot strange activity near the hospital. They might hear rumors of unusual late-night trash collection or strange behavior around the dumpsters, especially if the players disturb or investigate the area during their adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Dumpster Divers, Dude!</strong> I heard from my âsourcesââyeah, you heard me right, sourcesâthat some of you metalheads have been snoopinâ around Sister Sarahâs. Iâm tellinâ ya, itâs no joke. Weird stuffâs goin' on after midnight, and I KNOW theyâre throwinâ away more than used bandages. Trash gets picked up late at night, and itâs not your average garbage, man. Iâve seen the shadows move... too clean for comfort! Maybe theyâre takinâ out more than trash. Youâre brave, but donât get too close, or youâll end up on their hit list.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Metallicaâs âDisposable Heroesâ fades in for dramatic effect)</em></li>

<h3><strong>Bizarre Hospital Sightings</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Someone hears that the players encountered something disturbing or supernatural inside the hospitalâwhether itâs <strong>shadowy figures</strong>, <strong>inexplicable screams</strong>, or evidence of experiments. The players might spread rumors or slip details to a local, which eventually reaches Dave.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;The Bleach-Clean Hellhouse!&quot;</strong> &quot;So, I hear some of youâve gotten brave and checked out olâ Sister Sarahâs at night. The things you saw, huh? Shadows that move weird, patients that ainât exactly... <em>alive</em> anymore? Some of you vets know what Iâm talkinâ aboutâscreams in the night, bodies moved in and out faster than you can say 'medical malpractice.' You ever wonder whatâs really happeninâ back there? Well, wonder no more, manâitâs like a sci-fi slasher flick, but youâre IN IT. Just be careful, âcause THEY donât want anyone talkinâ.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Black Sabbathâs âInto the Voidâ as the music break)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Missing Staff or Patients</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Someone in town starts gossiping about missing hospital staff or patients after the playersâ investigation. Maybe the players rescued someone, or they uncovered something that led to hospital staff disappearing or being relocated by the cult. The community may notice staff turnover or unexplained absences.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Vanishing Acts at Sarahâs!&quot;</strong> &quot;You ever notice how people just... disappear? Yeah, like staff at Sister Sarahâs, man. Heard from a reliable source that some of the nurses and docs there just up and vanished. Or maybe itâs the patients? Hard to keep track. One minute theyâre there, next minuteâ<em>poof!</em>âgone. Itâs like magic, bro, except darker and creepier. You think they just quit? Nah, THEY know something we donât. I bet theyâre cleaning up their mess, and trust me, it ainât bandages and bedpans theyâre throwinâ out.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Judas Priestâs âBeyond the Realms of Deathâ)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>Increased Security at Sister Sarahâs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> After the players' investigation, security might increase at <strong>Sister Sarahâs Medical Center</strong>. Whether itâs more guards, stricter visitor rules, or rumors of the hospital becoming more secretive, locals might talk about how itâs harder to get in or how the staff seems more on edge.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Watch Your Back at Sarahâs!&quot;</strong> &quot;Heard from one of my night owls that security at Sarahâs has ramped up big time. Yeah, you didnât hear it from me, but they donât want anyone else pokin' around. Something big went down there recentlyâdonât ask me how I know, âcause I ainât sayin'. But if you think youâre gonna stroll in there for some late-night adventure, think again. Theyâre on high alert, man. Somethingâs got âem scared, and I bet you ten bucks it ainât just the bedbugs.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Megadethâs âWake Up Deadâ)</em></li>

<h3><strong>Prairie Hall and the Hospital Connection</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> If the players investigated both <strong>Prairie Hall</strong> and <strong>Sister Sarahâs</strong>, they might have discovered links between the two locationsâpossibly involving records, financial transactions, or even cult connections. Word of this investigation could trickle back to Dave, whoâll speculate wildly about the connections.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Museum of Horrors and Hospital of Doom!&quot;</strong> &quot;Iâve been tellin' you guys for agesâ<strong>Prairie Hall</strong> and <strong>Sister Sarahâs</strong> are connected. Donât believe me? Just think about it. Who keeps old medical records? The ones they donât want you to see? And where do they send the ones who know too much? <em>Bingo.</em> Prairie Hall ainât just some dusty old museumâitâs where they keep the skeletons in the closet, bro! And those skeletons are real! Next time youâre around there, look at the shadowsâthey might look back.&quot;<br/>
<em>(Plays Dioâs âHoly Diverâ)</em></li>

<h3><strong>The Players' Actions Leak into Daveâs Rant</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Someone recognizes the players as the ones sneaking around <strong>Sister Sarahâs</strong> or <strong>Prairie Hall</strong> and talks about their activities, leading Dave to speculate about who they are and what theyâre after.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Somebodyâs Lookinâ for Trouble!&quot;</strong> &quot;Hey, man, someoneâs been diggin' around where they donât belong. I ainât namin' names, but you know who you are. I respect the hustle, dudeâyou wanna know the truth, just like me. But be careful. Theyâve got eyes everywhere, and I bet youâre on their radar now. Hell, maybe youâve seen something you shouldnât. Just donât come cryin' to ol' Dave when THEY start knockin' on your door at 3 AM. Keep your head down, metal militia!&quot;<br/>

<h3><strong>A Follow-Up Investigation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What Dave Hears:</strong> Rumors spread that people (possibly even the players) have gone back to <strong>Sister Sarahâs</strong> or <strong>Prairie Hall</strong> for a second round of investigations. Dave, ever the conspiracy theorist, seizes on the idea that they must have found something important the first time and are digging deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Daveâs Broadcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Round Two at Sarahâs!&quot;</strong> &quot;Heard through the grapevine that some brave soulsâor maybe just plain crazyâhave gone back to Sister Sarahâs or that creepy museum. You know what that means, manâtheyâre onto something. You donât go back unless you found something worth the risk. So what did you see, huh? I bet itâs something THEY donât want getting out. You better be careful, âcause next time might be the last time you go in. But hey, if you find out something juicy, drop a tip to ol' DaveâIâm all ears!&quot;<br/>

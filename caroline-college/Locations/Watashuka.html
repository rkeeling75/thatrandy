<h1><strong>Public History of Watashuka</strong></h1>
<p><em>What most people think happened</em></p>
<h2><strong>May 1856</strong> â Founding of <strong>Prairieville Academy</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prairieville Academy</strong> is established as a teacher-training school (normal school) to educate future educators. The academy becomes the heart of the town of Prairieville, which later becomes Watashuka. The academy was the dream of three educators Walter Mann, Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling. There dream was to work with the local Ho-Chunk people to bring forth a new era for the region. That dream is still alive today despite setbacks.
<ul>
<li>Founding Members
<ul>
<li>Walter Mann: German immigrant, artist, head founder of the academy</li>
<li>Eleazar Root: Co-founder. Massachusetts school teacher, relocated</li>
<li>John W. Sterling: Co-founder, English businessman, relocated</li>
<li>Elias Haskins: Co-founder, local prominent cavalrymen</li>
<li>Jonathan Whitmore: Co-founder, local esteemed teacher and theologian</li>
<li>Sarah Johnson: Co-founder, local wealthy widow and philanthropist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>August 1860</strong> â Destruction of <strong>Prairieville Academy</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The academy is destroyed during a violent conflict between the settlers and a rogue native tribe who attacked the school. During the attack many of the educators and founders were killed; only Eleazar Root and John Sterling survived. The academy burned down. Many blame local tensions with indigenous people on the attack. Most records from this time are lost, and it remains a tragic, but poorly understood, event in local history.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>September 1862</strong> â Rebuilding of <strong>Prairieville School</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the wake of the academyâs destruction, the <strong>Prairieville School</strong> is built to continue the regionâs educational mission. Under the leadership of Eleazar Root and John W. Sterling the school thrives and grows as part of the effort to revitalize education in the region, attracting settlers to the area. Eleazar served as the school's first principal while John provided the financial and political support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blizzard of 1888 - Humanitarian Aid</h2>
<ul>
<li>After the <a href="../../caroline-college/Events/Blizzard-of-1888" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Events/Blizzard-of-1888">Blizzard of 1888</a>, large numbers of members of the <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Lutheran-Church" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Lutheran-Church">Lutheran Church</a> immigrate to the region. The first settlers arrive to provide humanitarian assistance but soon took to calling the region home.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>April 1895</strong> â <strong>Caroline Religious Teaching College</strong> Founded</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to the influence of Lutheran immigrants, the <strong>Caroline Religious Teaching College</strong> is established, expanding the former school into a larger institution focused on religious education. The town of <strong>Prairieville</strong> is renamed <strong>Watashuka</strong>, believed to be derived from a misinterpreted Native American word symbolizing the area's different cultural influences.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>1939-1945</strong> â World War II Efforts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Caroline Religious Teaching College contributes to the war effort, with local industry and students engaging in patriotic duties. The collegeâs science and engineering departments grow due to wartime funding. After the war, the college continues expanding its academic programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>1945</strong> â <strong>Caroline College</strong> Renamed</h2>
<ul>
<li>The college is officially renamed <strong>Caroline College</strong> after WWII, reflecting its role as a modern liberal arts institution. The post-war years bring growth and new facilities, including <strong>Sister Sarahâs Medical Center</strong>, a teaching hospital for nursing and healthcare students.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>1969</strong> â Population Decline</h2>
<ul>
<li>Watashukaâs population begins to decline in the late 1960s due to changing economic conditions; notably the closing of several government projects now deemed complete. People start leaving for larger cities like Madison and Milwaukee. The closing of some industries and the general economic downturn are seen as the reasons for this decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>1983-Present</strong> â Present Day Watashuka</h2>
<ul>
<li>Watashuka is a quiet rural town with Caroline College as its centerpiece. The town struggles economically, but the college brings new students and some level of vibrancy. Residents are largely unaware of any significant issues beyond normal small-town troubles.</li>

<h3>Atmosphere:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watashukaâs Main Street is the lifeblood of the town, though it has seen better days. Lined with small businesses and family-owned shops, it exudes a nostalgic charm. During the day, it bustles with locals running errands and small talk flowing between shopkeepers and customers. The sounds of typewriters, local radio, and the clinking of glasses at the Blue Heron Pub fill the air. However, as the sun sets, Main Street takes on a different tone. Shadows seem to stretch longer here, and the empty streets echo with an eerie silence. The old brick buildings, now weathered and fading, whisper of past prosperity, but thereâs a creeping unease. Those who remain after dark often speak of strange figures seen down alleys, and locked doors that rattle on their own.</li>
<li>The <strong>side streets</strong> add to the townâs atmosphere of quiet decay, with narrow, cobbled roads leading to forgotten businesses like old law firms and shuttered hardware stores. These roads seem darker at night, and thereâs a sense that they have stories of their ownâstories that no one speaks of openly. The occasional flash of movement in a dimly lit alley is enough to send most people hurrying back to the safety of Main Streetâs lights. Itâs a place where secrets linger, just beneath the surface of everyday life.</li>

Strange vehicles are sometimes seen in the area late at night, adding to the suspicion that these residents are involved in something beyond mundane government work.</li>

The streets are lined with mature trees and stately homes, giving the neighborhood an air of quiet respectability. On the surface, Sterling Hills feels safe and orderly, but thereâs an underlying tension among the residents, particularly those with ties to the college or government projects. The silence in the evenings can feel oppressive, and the long shadows cast by the aging street lamps make it easy to imagine something lurking just out of sight.</li>
<li>Caroline Collegeâs campus stands apart from the town of Watashuka, its stately buildings and green lawns giving it an air of academia and history. But beneath the calm, scholarly exterior lies a deeper mystery. The architecture is imposing, and some of the older buildings seem to hold secrets in their very walls. Students talk about the strange things that happen late at nightâflickering lights, unexplained noises, and locked doors that sometimes swing open on their own. The college is the intellectual and economic heart of Watashuka, but many suspect that it also holds the key to the townâs darkest secrets.</li>

The farmers are proud and self-reliant, yet the region has begun to experience odd disturbancesâanimals going missing, strange lights in the sky, and crops failing for no apparent reason. The Amish community nearby maintains a watchful eye, quietly dealing with these unnatural occurrences, while keeping their deeper knowledge to themselves.</li>
<li>The Amish lands to the northeast of Watashuka are serene and picturesque, with rolling hills, wide fields, and carefully maintained farms that seem untouched by time. Horse-drawn buggies travel along dirt roads, and the simple wooden homes and barns give the area a peaceful, pastoral quality. The air smells of fresh-cut hay and wood smoke, and the rhythmic sound of hammering and livestock creates a sense of calm industry. Life here feels slower and more purposeful, far removed from the chaos and strangeness that pervades the rest of the town. However, beneath this idyllic surface, there is an undercurrent of tension. The Amish community is quietly vigilant, guarding against the supernatural forces they know are at work in the region. They donât speak openly about it, but their farms are filled with subtle protective symbols and rituals passed down through generations. The land itself feels ancient, almost sacred, and there are placesâgroves, streams, and old stone fencesâwhere the air seems heavier, as if the land remembers something older and darker than anyone knows. Visitors often feel watched, though never threatened, and the locals are polite but distant, carefully guarding their secrets from outsiders. At night, the peaceful calm takes on a more unsettling tone. The lantern lights from the Amish homes are the only illumination for miles, and the darkness feels thicker here. Those who venture too far from the main roads speak of strange sounds from the woodsâlow, guttural noises that no animal should make, and lights flickering in the distance where no homes stand. The Amish lands are a place of quiet strength, but also one where ancient forces are constantly kept at bay.

<li><strong>Description</strong>: Located on the way out of town, heading towards <a href="../../caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Locations/Caroline-College">Caroline College</a>, K Squared is more than just a rural gas station. It serves as a morning pit stop for students and faculty on their way to class. In addition to fuel, the store offers coffee, breakfast snacks, and basic supplies. The Kilgore brothers are known for their friendly banter and keeping tabs on the local happenings. Despite their jokes, the brothers have noticed strange shifts in clientele, especially at night, though they stay tight-lipped about any odd occurrences.</li>

<li><strong>Description</strong>: Annieâs processing plant serves the rural hunting and farming communities around Watashuka. She processes everything from livestock to wild game for local farmers and hunters. The plant, located just off State Route 89, is a sprawling complex that smells of blood and meat. Annie has worked here her whole life and claims the strange noises she hears from the nearby woods are just the wind, though many of her workers whisper about shadowy figures spotted at dusk. Her knowledge of the land and its history runs deep, though she rarely shares her thoughts on the townâs oddities. She turns a blind eye to the activities that sometimes happen in the slaughter house after hours.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Streamwader's Hunting Goods</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Jim Watson, a grizzled Vietnam War vet and experienced outdoorsman.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Streamwaderâs shop is a small, rugged building filled with hunting rifles, bows, traps, and other outdoor equipment. Jim has lived in Watashuka for decades and loves to share his stories with the younger generation of hunters, though his more chilling tales are often dismissed as the ramblings of an old soldier. Despite his outwardly gruff demeanor, heâs a reliable source of information on the wilderness, particularly the Ho-Chunk land and the strange occurrences in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rural Communities</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Residents</strong>: Dairy farmers, crop growers, and livestock ranchers.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The sprawling farmland to the southwest is home to families who have lived in Watashuka for generations. These farmers are mostly self-sufficient, and many have an unspoken rule to mind their own business. However, odd crop failures and animal mutilations have been happening more frequently, and locals are growing increasingly uneasy. The rural residents are also wary of government projects and any outsiders, but their tight-lipped nature keeps them from sharing too much with the town.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ho-Chunk Information Center</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curator</strong>: Mary Whitecloud, a knowledgeable and reserved Ho-Chunk woman in her late 40s.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This small center serves as an educational hub about the Ho-Chunk people, their history, and their culture. The building is humble but welcoming, with displays about Ho-Chunk traditions and artifacts. Mary runs the center, offering tours and answering questions from visitors, but she remains guarded about the deeper spiritual knowledge of her people. Only a few trusted individuals are ever told about the ongoing efforts to protect the land from supernatural threats, and the information center serves as a front for some of these activities.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Wet Spot</strong>

<li><strong>Description</strong>: Despite its seedy reputation, The Wet Spot is a popular hangout for college students, known for cheap drinks and live music. The club, located just outside town limits near Lake Mary, sees far less occult activity than other places in Watashuka. Tony, the owner, loves catering to the college crowd, offering student discounts and hosting wild theme nights. Locals mostly avoid the place, but for Caroline College students, itâs a spot to unwind away from prying eyes. Though rumors swirl about shady dealings, Tony keeps a tight lid on any trouble, preferring to keep things legalâand profitable.</li>

<li>Border of Ho-Chunk Native People's Lands</li>
</ul>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Downs are a mix of sprawling farmlands and quiet, isolated properties. The air is thick with the smell of fresh hay and the sound of distant tractors, creating a rural, down-to-earth feel. Itâs a hard-working community where people keep to themselves and don't ask too many questions, but lately, even the most stoic farmers have begun to notice strange crop failures and unexplainable happenings. The occasional whiff of something unnatural in the air adds a layer of unease to this otherwise tranquil countryside. The Ho-Chunk lands just beyond the townâs limits only add to the mystery, with many locals choosing to avoid the area at night.</li>
<li>The Ho-Chunk lands are sacred and revered, with a strong connection to the spiritual and supernatural forces of the region. The area is quiet, peaceful, and somewhat eerie. The trees here seem older, and the wind carries with it the weight of ancient history. Many in Watashuka avoid this part of the land, either out of respect or fear, but the Ho-Chunk people themselves are watchful, aware of the forces at work both on their land and in the surrounding town. Thereâs a sense of hidden power hereâsomething deep and old that most people donât understand but can feel all the same.</li>

<h3>Outside the town limits to the Southeast: &quot;Lakeview Shores&quot;</h3>
<p>Â <em>{Feel: Resort attractions that have seen better days.}</em></p>
<p>Once a thriving vacation destination, <strong>Lakeview Shores</strong> has seen better days. Nestled along the edge of Lake &quot;View,&quot; this aging resort area was once popular with families seeking outdoor recreation, but a combination of economic decline and neglect has left it in a state of disrepair. The area is now frequented by locals, campers, and the occasional nostalgic visitor, though the glory days are long gone.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sit n' Eat Diner and Motel</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Doris Larkin, a friendly but world-weary woman in her 60s who runs the place single-handedly.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This diner and attached motel are classic roadside Americana, with faded neon signs and a cracked parking lot. Once a bustling stop for tourists, the rooms are now sparsely occupied, and the diner serves mostly local regulars. Despite the wear and tear, Doris keeps the food hot and the coffee flowing. The motel rooms are clean but dated, with dÃ©cor that hasnât been updated since the 1970s. Itâs a quiet place to restâaside from the occasional strange sounds coming from the lake at night.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Lake (Public House)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Tom &quot;Big T&quot; Lawson, a burly man in his 50s with a passion for local history and cheap beer.</li>

The tavern has a large deck overlooking the water, though the view is often shrouded in mist, adding an eerie ambiance. Inside, fishing trophies and old photos of Lakeviewâs heyday decorate the walls. Big T is always ready to share stories of the lakeâs supposed mysteries, though most patrons dismiss them as drunken ramblings. It is almost never visited by college students and is considered a 'locals only' establishment. &quot;Its the only place in town where a good Lutheran can get a drink.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lakeside RV Park &amp; Campground</strong>

<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Marty and Sue Briggs, an aging couple who have managed the site for over 30 years.</li>

<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Jane and Bob Wheeler, a friendly couple in their late 40s trying to revive the area.</li>

The building is quaint but worn, with a cheery atmosphere inside. Some locals say the market is the last ânormalâ place in Lakeview Shores, untouched by the areaâs growing strangeness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lakeview Lakeside Fun Center (Mini Golf &amp; Arcade)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Dave and Cathy Arnold, a laid-back couple in their 50s who refuse to let the place die.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The Lakeview Fun Center was once a bustling family attraction, complete with mini golf, an arcade, and boat rentals. These days, the mini golf course is overgrown, and most of the arcade machines are out of order, save for a few that still functionâbarely. Dave and Cathy are known for their easygoing attitudes, keeping the place open even if it only gets a few visitors a day. Thereâs a haunted feeling to the abandoned games and rusting golf obstacles, but the Arnolds shrug it off, insisting itâs all in good fun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Playhouse on the Lake</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Nancy Bright, a former actress who settled down after her career ended.</li>

Now, itâs mostly abandoned, with only a few amateur productions each year. Nancy, an eccentric woman with a flair for the dramatic, still dreams of restoring the theater to its former glory, though few share her enthusiasm. The Playhouse is said to be haunted by the ghost of a former actor who died during a performance, but Nancy waves off such rumors with a smile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The View New Age Shop</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Lucinda &quot;Luce&quot; Moore, a free-spirited woman in her 40s with a deep interest in the supernatural.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This small, quirky shop offers crystals, tarot readings, and other New Age paraphernalia. Luce is one of the few people in Lakeview Shores who embraces the strange energy of the area, and sheâs always ready to discuss local legends or offer advice on warding off spirits. The shop is popular with college students and visitors interested in the occult, though locals are often skeptical of Luceâs claims about the lakeâs mystical powers. Sheâs known to host moonlit gatherings by the lake, though only a few daring souls ever attend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Atmosphere</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite its decline, <strong>Lakeview Shores</strong> holds a certain charm for those who appreciate faded beauty and quiet reflection. However, thereâs an undercurrent of mystery and neglect here. The lake, once a source of joy, now seems shrouded in fog and whispers of the unknown. Locals and visitors alike canât shake the feeling that something is lurking just beneath the surface, but most choose to ignore the oddities in favor of nostalgia and the hope that this forgotten resort town might one day return to its former glory. Once a bustling summer retreat, Lakeview Shores has an air of forgotten grandeur. The overgrown paths, weathered motels, and silent campgrounds hint at better days, but now the area feels haunted by time. The lake itself is shrouded in mist more often than not, and strange things are said to happen at nightâlights on the water, eerie sounds, and the occasional disappearance. Despite its decline, Lakeview Shores retains a nostalgic charm for those who remember its heyday, but visitors and locals alike canât shake the feeling that something is lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered.</li>
<li>Lakeview is a working-class neighborhood with a sense of faded optimism. Many of its residents are struggling to make ends meet, and the areaâs rundown houses and overgrown lots are signs of its slow decline. Yet, thereâs a strong community spirit here, where neighbors help each other out, and children still play in the streets. The boarded-up windows and crumbling facades tell the story of a once-thriving part of town, but the people hold onto hope that better days are coming.

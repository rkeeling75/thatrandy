<h2><strong>Overview</strong>:</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ho-Chunk Nation</strong>, also known as the <strong>People of the Sacred Voice</strong>, have lived on the land surrounding Watashuka for centuries, long before European settlers arrived. Deeply connected to the natural world and the spiritual energies that flow through the earth, the Ho-Chunk are the ancient protectors of the region’s <strong>ley lines</strong>—the powerful, invisible pathways that connect the land to the <strong>supernatural realms</strong>.</p>
<p>The Ho-Chunk have always known that the land they call home is special, a place where the boundaries between worlds are thinner, and where spiritual energy pools in certain sacred sites. These ley lines are both a blessing and a curse, offering great power but also attracting dark forces that seek to exploit them. The Ho-Chunk’s traditional role has been to guard these sites, using their spiritual knowledge and rituals to protect the land from those who would misuse its power—whether they be human or something far older and more dangerous.</p>
<p>Though their numbers have dwindled, the Ho-Chunk continue to fulfill this ancient duty, even in the face of growing threats from government projects, local cults, and the encroaching modern world.</p>
<h2><strong>Beliefs and Role as Guardians</strong>:</h2>
<p>The Ho-Chunk believe that the <strong>ley lines</strong> are pathways that connect the natural world to the <strong>spiritual realms</strong>, channels through which energy flows between different dimensions. Certain points along these lines, known as <strong>&quot;power nodes,&quot;</strong> are places where the veil between worlds is thinnest, and where great spiritual power can be harnessed—either for good or ill.</p>
<p>For the Ho-Chunk, these sites are sacred. They see themselves as the appointed guardians of the land, responsible for maintaining the balance between the natural and supernatural worlds. Their role is to ensure that the ley lines remain undisturbed, and that the <strong>ancient entities</strong> that dwell beyond the veil are not summoned or awakened.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rituals of Protection</strong>: The Ho-Chunk use <strong>rituals</strong> passed down through generations to safeguard the ley lines. These rituals involve chanting, the use of <strong>sacred herbs</strong>, and the drawing of protective <strong>symbols</strong> on the earth. The Ho-Chunk know that certain rituals must be performed regularly to keep the ley lines in balance, preventing any one group from harnessing too much of their power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication with Spirits</strong>: The Ho-Chunk maintain a deep connection to the <strong>spirit world</strong>. Their shamans, known as <strong>&quot;Wąąk Toošewe,&quot;</strong> act as intermediaries between the human world and the spirits of the land. These shamans can sense disturbances in the ley lines and are able to communicate with the <strong>spirits of nature</strong> to help keep the land protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eldritch Awareness</strong>: Unlike the local settlers, who only recently discovered the dangers of the <strong>eldritch forces</strong> lurking beneath Watashuka, the Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the presence of these beings. They refer to these ancient entities as <strong>&quot;the <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/Hungry-Ones" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/Hungry-Ones">Hungry Ones</a>&quot;</strong>, spirits who were banished from the natural world long ago and now seek to return through breaches in the ley lines. The Ho-Chunk believe that once the Hungry Ones are allowed into this world, they will consume all life, and their return must be prevented at all costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Relationship with the Amish</strong>:</h2>
<p>Though the Ho-Chunk and the <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Amish" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Amish">Amish</a> come from vastly different cultural backgrounds, they have shared a common purpose since the late <strong>19th century</strong>: the protection of the land from <strong>supernatural threats</strong>. The alliance between the two groups was born out of necessity in the <strong>1890s</strong>, when a failed ritual by <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom">Church of the Delayed Blossom</a> nearly brought an <strong>eldritch entity</strong> into the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Alliance</strong>: At first, the Amish and the Ho-Chunk were wary of one another. The Amish, with their Christian beliefs, were initially suspicious of the Ho-Chunk’s spiritual practices, while the Ho-Chunk saw the Amish as outsiders who did not understand the land’s deeper significance. However, after the <strong>Blizzard of 1888</strong>, the two groups found common ground in their shared desire to protect the land from the forces that sought to corrupt it. Though the alliance is largely unspoken, both groups respect one another and often work together in secret to combat threats to the ley lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintaining Distance</strong>: Despite their cooperation, the Ho-Chunk and Amish maintain separate spheres of influence. The Ho-Chunk focus on the <strong>ley lines</strong> and <strong>sacred sites</strong>, while the Amish use their <strong>herbal magic</strong> and <strong>symbolic protections</strong> to guard their farmlands and the surrounding area. The two groups communicate infrequently, but when major disturbances occur, they come together to combine their knowledge and abilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Recent Conflicts</strong>:</h2>
<h3><strong>Government Encroachment (1930s-Present)</strong>:</h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk have become increasingly concerned with the <strong>U.S. government’s</strong> activities in the region, particularly the founding of <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline">Project Caroline</a> in the 1940s. Though the government claims its experiments are purely scientific, the Ho-Chunk know that the government is tampering with forces beyond their control, disturbing the ley lines in dangerous ways. The Ho-Chunk elders have issued warnings to the local authorities, but these have been ignored or dismissed as superstitious nonsense.</p>
<h3>Shamanic Observations:</h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk shamans have noted strange fluctuations in the ley lines ever since <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/Amy-Mann" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/Amy-Mann">Dr. Amy Mann</a> experiments in the early 1980s. They believe that the creation of the <strong>time loop</strong> in 1983 is a direct result of the government’s meddling with the ley lines, and they have been working tirelessly to find a way to break the loop and restore balance to the land.</p>
<h3><strong>Cults of Watashuka</strong>:</h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk have long been aware of the two rival cults operating in Watashuka. Both cults seek to exploit the ley lines for their own dark purposes, and the Ho-Chunk view them as a constant threat.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom">Church of the Delayed Blossom</a>: The Ho-Chunk see the <strong>Church of the Delayed Blossom</strong>, followers of <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath">Shub-Niggurath</a>, as dangerous because of their focus on corrupting the natural world. The church’s fertility rituals threaten to warp the land, and the Ho-Chunk have intervened on numerous occasions to stop these rituals before they could come to fruition.</li>
<li><a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled">Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled</a>: The Ho-Chunk are more wary the <strong>Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled</strong>, whose experiments with time manipulation could have catastrophic consequences for the entire region, the world or even the universe. The Brotherhood’s attempts to create rifts in time threaten to unravel the fabric of reality, and the Ho-Chunk have dedicated themselves to preventing these rituals from succeeding.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Key Ho-Chunk Figures</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Chief John Nąąhųc (Tree Bear)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: The current leader of the Ho-Chunk in the Watashuka region, Chief John Nąąhųc is a respected elder who has guided his people through many hardships. He is deeply connected to the spiritual forces of the land and takes his role as guardian of the ley lines very seriously. Nąąhųc is stoic and cautious, believing that the best way to protect the land is through quiet vigilance and careful intervention. He has worked closely with the Amish when necessary but prefers to keep his people out of the town’s politics. He is known for his love of Dr. Pepper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jane Deerwalker</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: One of the most powerful <strong>Wąąk Toošewe</strong> (shamans) in the Ho-Chunk community, Jane Deerwalker is responsible for maintaining the spiritual balance of the ley lines. She has the ability to sense disturbances in the spiritual realm and often serves as the first line of defense when the cults or government experiments cause disruptions. Jane is known for her wisdom and is often consulted by Chief Nąąhųc on matters related to the supernatural. She is particularly wary of the time loop created by Dr. Amy Mann and has been working on a way to counteract its effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ketih Redfeather</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: A young Ho-Chunk warrior and apprentice to Deerwalker, Keith Redfeather is fiercely protective of his people and the land. He often serves as a scout, keeping an eye on the activities of both the cults and the government. Though he lacks the spiritual experience of his elders, Keith is brave and quick to act, often clashing with his more cautious superiors. He is deeply suspicious of outsiders and is particularly hostile toward Project Caroline, seeing it as a direct threat to the ley lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2><strong>Key Locations</strong>:</h2>
<h3><strong>Grove of the Two Trees</strong>:</h3>
<p>This <strong>sacred site</strong> is a powerful ley line node where two ancient oak trees stand, their roots intertwined in a way that suggests they have grown together for centuries. The Ho-Chunk believe this grove is one of the most important power points in the region and perform regular rituals here to maintain balance. <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom">Church of the Delayed Blossom</a> has attempted to use this site for mutation rituals, but the Ho-Chunk have successfully defended it each time.</p>
<h3><strong>The Caves of Lake Mary</strong>:</h3>
<p>These caves, located near Lake Mary, are believed to be an entry point to the spirit world. The Ho-Chunk used to use the caves for their most sacred ceremonies before the events of <a href="../../caroline-college/Events/The-Baptism-of-'39" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Events/The-Baptism-of-'39">The Baptism of '39</a>. Now only <strong>Wąąk Toošewe</strong> are allowed to enter. The caves are said to contain <strong>ancient carvings</strong> that map the ley lines and predict the coming of the Hungry Ones if the ley lines are ever fully corrupted.</p>
<h2><strong>Legacy</strong>:</h2>
<p>The Ho-Chunk’s presence in Watashuka has been largely overshadowed by the town’s more visible history, but their role as guardians of the ley lines remains vital. In a town filled with hidden dangers—government conspiracies, warring cults, and supernatural entities—the Ho-Chunk continue to protect the balance, often without recognition or thanks. Their vigilance is all that stands between the land and the ancient forces that seek to consume it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<h3><strong>Preserving Sacred Sites:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk are quietly protecting their sacred sites from government and cult interference. This effort puts them at odds with Project Caroline, which is conducting experiments on or near these locations.</p>
<h3><strong>Sharing Knowledge with the Amish:</strong></h3>
<p>Some members of the Ho-Chunk are working with the Amish to exchange ancient knowledge. This uneasy alliance is based on mutual respect but could fall apart if trust is broken.</p>
<h3><strong>Break the Time Loop:</strong></h3>
<p>Elders of the tribe have detected the time loop and attempt to either break the loop or at least pass knowledge from loop to the next.</p>
<h3><strong>Combating Created Monsters:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk attempt to destroy the monstrosities that the cult create.</p>
<h3><strong>Sabotaging Cult Rituals:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk are actively working to disrupt the cult rituals, particularly those that desecrate the land. They may use their spiritual knowledge to neutralize dark powers, unknowingly aligning with the Amish in these efforts.</p>
<h3><strong>Advising Caroline College Faculty:</strong></h3>
<p>Certain Ho-Chunk leaders are offering subtle guidance to faculty at Caroline College, steering them away from research paths that might inadvertently lead to supernatural dangers. This puts them in quiet conflict with Project Caroline operatives.</p>
<h3><strong>Fostering Cultural Awareness:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk people are working to promote cultural awareness through the Ho-Chunk Cultural Heritage Museum, hoping to protect their traditions from external influences. This brings them into indirect conflict with Project Caroline’s attempts to exploit their knowledge. It is through this awareness that the tribe hopes to pass knowledge from one time loop to the next. They make use of the various museums and heritage centers in the region for this.</p>
<h3><strong>Monitoring Project Caroline:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk are aware of the government attempts to make use of eldritch magic. They are actively attempting to stop this exploitation as they believe that the government does not understand the dangers they are putting every at risk of.</p>
<h3><strong>Neutralizing Government Technology:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk are using their spiritual practices to subtly interfere with government surveillance and experiments, particularly in areas they deem sacred.</p>
<h3><strong>Guarding Against Yog-Sothoth Followers:</strong></h3>
<p>The Ho-Chunk are closely watching the cult of Yog-Sothoth, believing that their summoning rituals could unleash devastating forces. They are actively working to stop these rituals but may come into conflict with the Amish over methods and intentions.</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right

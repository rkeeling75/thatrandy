<h2><strong>Event Description</strong>:</h2>
<p>The supernatural disaster that locals now call <strong>The Baptism of '39</strong> was the result of a failed time-manipulation ritual by <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled">Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled</a>. What began as a sinister attempt to manipulate the ley lines and access alternate timelines spiraled out of control when misled members of the <strong>Lutheran Church</strong>, believing they were conducting a mass baptism, became unwitting participants in the ritual.</p>
<h2><strong>The Cover Story</strong>:</h2>
<p>According to the officialâand widely believedâversion of events, the <strong>Lutheran pastor</strong>, <strong>Reverend Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Olsen</strong>, led a congregation down to <strong>Lake Mary</strong> for a large-scale baptism ceremony on <strong>October 13, 1939</strong>. The pastor, a well-respected man in his 50s with a warm and charismatic presence, had recently gathered a group of new converts who were eager to be baptized together. The ceremony took place at dusk, with over a dozen parishioners, young and old, standing along the shore of the lake, singing hymns and preparing to enter the water.</p>
<p>As they began the ritual, something went terribly wrong. Inexplicable phenomena occurredâstrange lights flickered above the water, and a sudden, bone-chilling fog rolled in from nowhere. The water in the lake rose, unnaturally high, forming bizarre swirling patterns. Congregants were pulled into the water by unseen forces, while others stood frozen in place, unable to move or speak. The skies above seemed to shimmer, and witnesses described seeing distorted reflections in the lakeâvisions of past and future events, alternate versions of themselves, and eerie figures that never existed.</p>
<p>The church members were trapped in what seemed like a <strong>time anomaly</strong>, as the rising waters of Lake Mary acted as a temporal gateway. Some were thrown forward in time, while others vanished entirely. A few survivors were found later, dazed and confused, with no memory of the event beyond stepping into the water. Local authorities chalked it up to a freak accident, but those closest to the church whispered about <strong>demonic interference</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>The True Cause</strong>:</h2>
<p>Unbeknownst to <strong>Reverend Olsen</strong> or his congregation, the baptism was actually the culmination of a ritual being conducted by <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled">Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled</a>. Cultists embedded within the congregation had altered the baptismâs timing and location to coincide with an arcane ritual designed to manipulate time. Their goal was to create a rift in time using the ley lines converging at <strong>Lake Mary</strong>, allowing them to gain knowledge from alternate dimensions and use that power to summon the &quot;original god.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the interference of the Lutheran congregationâbelieving they were engaged in a holy ritualâdisrupted the cultâs carefully laid plans. The energy they had hoped to harness from the ley lines surged out of control, and instead of manipulating time in a controlled way, they unleashed an unstable rift. The rising waters of Lake Mary became a temporal whirlpool, pulling people into alternate timelines and distorting reality.</p>
<h2><strong>Aftermath</strong>:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the Cults</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Brotherhood-of-the-Gate-Unveiled">Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled</a> suffered a major setback. The ritual had backfired spectacularly, resulting in the deaths or disappearances of several high-ranking cult members who were caught in the time anomaly. Some cultists were flung into the future or past, while others were twisted into bizarre, unrecognizable forms by their exposure to alternate dimensions. The Brotherhoodâs leadership was left fractured, and they were forced to retreat deeper into secrecy to rebuild their power and recover from the failed ritual.</li>
<li><a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom">Church of the Delayed Blossom</a> saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath">Shub-Niggurath</a>, often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence. See below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For the Lutheran Church</strong>:<br/>
Reverend Fred Olsen was devastated by the event. He had no knowledge of the cultâs involvement, and in his eyes, the tragedy was a catastrophic accidentâa test of faith. Reverend Olsen became more reclusive in the years following the event, haunted by the loss of his parishioners. The survivors, confused and traumatized, were never the same, and many left the church. The Baptism of '39 remains a stain on the churchâs history, and the Lutheran congregation worked hard to distance themselves from the event, reinforcing the cover story that it had been a freak natural disaster.</li>
<li><strong>For the Town</strong>:<br/>
Most locals accepted the churchâs explanation of the event. While rumors of supernatural occurrences circulated, particularly among older residents, the official story held. The <strong>Baptism of '39</strong> became a cautionary tale about the dangers of Lake Mary, with many avoiding the lake after dark for fear of &quot;bad luck&quot; or worse. The lake developed a reputation for being haunted, and strange phenomena continued to be reported in the years following the eventâechoes of voices from the past, distorted reflections in the water, and the occasional unexplained disappearance.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Government Involvement and the Birth of Project Caroline</strong>:</h2>
<p>While the locals might have accepted the cover story, the government took notice of the strange anomalies surrounding the Baptism of '39. Reports of missing persons, time distortions, and bizarre weather patterns at Lake Mary reached the desk of <strong>Agent Howard Fitzsimmons</strong>, a sharp and inquisitive investigator with the <strong>Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD)</strong>âa government agency tasked with exploring unusual phenomena, especially during the early years of WWII.</p>
<p>Fitzsimmons, in his early 40s and known for his no-nonsense approach, was sent to investigate. He quickly determined that something far more unusual than a baptism had taken place. Interviews with survivors and local authorities, as well as his own experience with classified government experiments, led Fitzsimmons to conclude that the ley lines around Lake Mary had been disturbed by some kind of occult activity. He suspected that the event was tied to <strong>time manipulation</strong>, though he lacked concrete evidence.</p>
<p>Fitzsimmonsâ report to the OSRD recommended further investigation into the supernatural properties of the Watashuka region. His superiors, impressed by his findings and the potential implications for time manipulation in wartime technology, authorized the creation of <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Project-Caroline">Project Caroline</a> in 1940. Fitzsimmons was appointed as the projectâs first director, tasked with uncovering the secrets of the ley lines and understanding how the energies around Watashuka could be harnessed.</p>
<h2><strong>Legacy of the Baptism of '39</strong>:</h2>
<p>The Baptism of '39 became the founding event for <strong>Project Caroline</strong>, the top-secret government initiative that would study the supernatural forces at work in Watashuka for decades to come. Fitzsimmonsâ work laid the foundation for the projectâs ongoing investigation into time anomalies, ley lines, and the influence of the cults operating in the shadows of the town.</p>
<p>Though Reverend Olsen and the Lutheran Church continued to distance themselves from the tragedy, the event marked the beginning of a new chapter in Watashukaâs secret historyâone where government agents, cults, and local residents became unwitting players in a much larger cosmic game.</p>
<h2>The Wet Spot: The Aftermath of a Failed Ritual</h2>
<p>(A Cult Capitalizing on Rival Failure and Hidden Desires)</p>
<p>The Baptism of '39 of 1939 not only left deep scars on Watashuka's lakes and time itself but also created lingering, unseen consequences in the land and people near Lake Mary. While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled suffered a tremendous setback from their failed time manipulation ritual, their rivalsâ <a href="../../caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/Factions/Church-of-the-Delayed-Blossom">Church of the Delayed Blossom</a> âsaw an opportunity.</p>
<p>The botched ritual had temporarily destabilized the ley lines near Lake Mary, leaving the area around it highly susceptible to supernatural corruption and manipulation. The Delayed Blossom cult saw this as fertile ground for their own ends. <a href="../../caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath" class="internal alias" data-slug="caroline-college/NPCs/Shub-Niggurath">Shub-Niggurath</a>, often associated with fertility, transformation, and unchecked growth, thrived on manipulating primal human desires, including sexuality and indulgence.</p>
<h3>The Founding of The Wet Spot:</h3>
<p>In the early 1940s, shortly after the Baptism of '39, a quiet shift occurred in the area just beyond the town limits, near Lake Mary. What had once been a respectable lakeside resort fell into disrepair, as locals avoided the area due to the unnatural feelings of discomfort and fear. Without fully understanding why, residents felt uneasy near the water, especially at night. Many reported strange dreams or sudden impulses they couldnât explain.</p>
<p>Sensing the opportunity, members of the Church of the Delayed Blossom began subtly influencing the land and those who still ventured near Lake Mary. Over time, their efforts coalesced into something more overt. In 1952, under the guidance of &quot;Big&quot; Tony DâAmato, an outsider with connections to the townâs seedier elements, The Wet Spot was established. Officially an adult establishment, The Wet Spot catered to the baser instincts of the town's populationâsex, indulgence, and secrecy. Unofficially, it became a node of power for the Delayed Blossom, feeding off the suppressed desires of its patrons and slowly corrupting the land further.</p>
<h3>The Church of the Delayed Blossomâs Influence:</h3>
<p>The Church of the Delayed Blossom thrives on exploiting the primal, chaotic aspects of humanity, particularly sexuality, fertility, and uncontrolled growth. The establishment of The Wet Spot near Lake Mary, on land already tainted by the failed ritual, allowed the cult to further anchor their influence in Watashuka.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexuality as a Tool: For the Delayed Blossom cult, sexuality is not just a human urgeâit is a form of power. By opening an establishment like The Wet Spot, the cult taps into the suppressed desires of the town, using the indulgence of lust and vice as a way to fuel their rituals. The sexual energy released at the club serves as a type of fertility magic, subtly warping the land and spreading Shub-Niggurathâs influence through the area.</li>
<li>Twisting the Failure: While the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in their time manipulation, the Delayed Blossom found a way to benefit from the weakened ley lines. The ritualâs disruption left Lake Maryâs surroundings spiritually vulnerable, making it easier for the Delayed Blossom to exert their influence over the region and its residents. The Wet Spot, positioned in an area avoided by most locals, became a hidden focal point for the cultâs activities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Wet Spotâs Reputation:</h3>
<p>To this day, The Wet Spot maintains its outward appearance as a sleazy but profitable adult establishment, frequented by college students and visitors passing through. While most of the town avoids the place, chalking it up to personal morals or discomfort, many donât realize that the real reason they stay away stems from the lingering supernatural energy left over from the 1939 event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Atmosphere: Those who do visit often report a strange atmosphere in the club. The air feels thick, like itâs charged with something unexplainable. Time seems to slow, and people lose track of the hours they spend inside. There are rumors that some patrons have gone missing, never seen again after a night out at the club, though this is written off as typical seedy rumors.</li>
<li>Unnatural Growth: Unbeknownst to most, The Wet Spot serves as a breeding ground for darker, more unnatural forces. The cult uses the energy of indulgence and sexual desire to foster their connection to Shub-Niggurath. Some areas near the club are marked by strange growthsâtwisted plants, unusual fertility in the soil, and occasional sightings of hybrid creatures, believed to be the results of dark rituals.</li>
<li>Dormant Power: The Delayed Blossom cult maintains a low profile, using The Wet Spot as a cover for their true activities. While not every patron is affected by the cultâs influence, those who frequent the establishment regularly often find themselves plagued by strange dreams and desires. Some even become unwitting pawns in the cultâs ongoing efforts to manipulate and corrupt the townâs ley lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legacy of the Baptism of '39:</h3>
<p>The Baptism of '39âs aftermath left scars not only on the landscape but on the people as well. The Wet Spot, though seemingly just an adult entertainment venue, is a lingering reminder of how the disrupted ritual in 1939 forever altered the spiritual fabric of Watashuka. Where the Brotherhood of the Gate Unveiled failed in controlling time, the Church of the Delayed Blossom succeeded in harnessing the primal urges of humanity to further their influence in the town.</p>
